Before an extension can be installed into a VSTS account, it must be shared with that account. Sharing is a requirement during development and testing of an extension, as it is the only way to run an extension.

To share an extension so it can be installed:

1. Click an extension from the list of displayed items 
2. Click the **Share** button
3. Specify the name of the VSTS account to make this extension visible to.
    For example, to make an extension visible to the fabrikam-fiber-inc.visualstudio.com account, specify `fabrikam-fiber-inc`.
