Once your extension has been packaged, you can upload it to the Marketplace under a publisher. The `publisher` identifer specified in your [extension's manifest file](../../develop/manifest.md) must match the identifier of the publisher the extension is uploaded under.

To upload an extension to the Marketplace:

1. Navigate to the [Visual Studio Marketplace Publishing Portal](http://aka.ms/vsmarketplace-manage)
2. Find the <b>Upload new extension</b> button, navigate to your packaged .vsix file, and select <i>upload</i>.
3. After a quick validation, your extension will appear in the extensions list: 
    ![first](../../publish/_img/manage-first.png)

At this point, your extension is not visible to any accounts and cannot be installed until you share it.
