If you can't see the Extensions tab, make sure you're in the control panel
(the project collection level administration page - ```https://{account}.visualstudio.com/_admin/```)
and not the administration page for a team project.

If you're on the control panel, and you don't see the **Extensions** tab,
extensions may not be enabled for your account.
You can get early access to the extensions feature by [joining the Visual Studio Partner Program](https://vsipprogram.com/join).
