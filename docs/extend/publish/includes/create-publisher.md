Every item on the Visual Studio Marketplace, including extensions and integrations, belong to a publisher. 

A publisher is owned by a user, typically the user that created it, and can also be shared with other users.

1. Sign in to the [Visual Studio Marketplace Publishing Portal](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/createpublisher?managePageRedirect=true).
2. If you're not already a member of an existing publisher, you're prompted to create a publisher. If you're not prompted to create a publisher, scroll down to the bottom of the page and select **Publish extensions** underneath *Related sites*.
    * Specify an identifer for your publisher, for example: `mycompany-myteam`
        * This is used as the value for the `publisher` attribute in your extension manifest file.
    * Specify a display name for your publisher, for example: `My Team`
3. Review the [Marketplace Publisher Agreement](https://aka.ms/vsmarketplace-agreement), and then select **Create**.

Once the publisher's created, you're directed to manage items, which has no items.
