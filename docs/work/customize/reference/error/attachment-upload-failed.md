This message might appear in a dialog box when you save a work item that has attachments. The problem might be intermittent and difficult to reproduce.  
  
**Possible Causes**  
  
The client computer might not be configured to automatically detect the link speed of its network adapter. This setting might decrease performance between the client computer and Visual Studio Team Foundation Server.  
  
**Solutions**  
  
On the client computer, enable automatic detection of the link speed for the network adapter. For more information, see [Configure a network adapter to automatically adjust speed](../configure-network-adapter-automatically-adjust-speed.md).
