# About Scrum and project management 

[!INCLUDEÂ [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

The Scrum method uses sprints to plan work to perform by a team within a specific time period and cadence. To get started, several sprints are predefined for your team.  If you're new to Scrum, get an overview from [What is Scrum?](https://www.visualstudio.com/learn/what-is-scrum/). 

[![Schedule sprints](../backlogs/_img/overview/gs-planning-define-sprints.png)](define-sprints.md)[![Plan a sprint](../backlogs/_img/overview/gs-planning-plan-sprint.png)](sprint-planning.md)[![Monitor sprint progress](../backlogs/_img/overview/gs-planning-monitor-sprint.png)](task-board.md)[![Forecast](../backlogs/_img/overview/gs-planning-forecast.png)](forecast.md)

You can quickly assign work items to a sprint by dragging and dropping them from the product backlog to the sprint.
