## Move work items to a sprint from any backlog or board

From any backlog, you can drag a multi-selected list of work items and drop it onto a sprint to change it's iteration path. From a Kanban or task board, you can drag a single work item onto a sprint. 

Child items of the work items whose iteration path you change are also updated with the new iteration path.
