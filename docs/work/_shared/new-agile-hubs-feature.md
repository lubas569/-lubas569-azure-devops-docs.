> [!NOTE]
> The **New navigation** feature, which provides a vertical navigation experience, is in preview for VSTS. [Go here to enable it](../../project/navigation/preview-features.md). When you enable **New navigation**, you automatically enable several new Agile tool features described in this blog post, [New Work Hubs](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2018/06/22/new-work-hubs/). For on-premises TFS users, choose **Previous navigation** for guidance.
