> With **witadmin**, you can [import and export definition files](/vsts/work/customize/reference/witadmin/witadmin-customize-and-manage-objects-for-tracking-work). Other tools you can use include the Process Editor (requires that you have installed a version of Visual Studio):
> - For TFS 2017 and later versions, [install the TFS Process Template editor from the Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KarthikBalasubramanianMSFT.TFSProcessTemplateEditor). You can use this version of the Process Editor to modify the old-style work item forms. You can't use it to edit forms associated with the [new web forms](/vsts/work/customize/process/new-work-item-experience). 
> - For TFS 2015 and earlier versions, install [TFS Power Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TFSPowerToolsTeam.MicrosoftVisualStudioTeamFoundationServer2015Power). 
>
>Or, you can use the [TFS Team Project Manager](https://github.com/jelledruyts/TfsTeamProjectManager), an open-source client available from github.
