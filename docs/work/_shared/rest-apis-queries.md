### REST API and SDK resources  

To programmatically interact with queries, see one of these REST API resources:  

- [Fetch work items with queries programatically in VSTS](/vsts/integrate/quickstarts/work-item-quickstart) 
- [Queries](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/vsts/wit/queries)
- [Work item query language](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/vsts/wit/wiql)

Or, for TFS 2015 and earlier versions, [Query for Bugs, Tasks, and Other Work Items](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb130306(v=vs.120).aspx).
