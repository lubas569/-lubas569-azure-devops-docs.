> If your admin has installed the [Work item search extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-workitem-search), the search box will perform an adhoc query using the extension. You'll no longer be able to initiate a managed search. Instead, you'll need to open the **Work>Queries** page and construct a query. To learn more, see [Adhoc vs managed work item queries](../track/adhoc-vs-managed-queries.md).
