## Definitions for common WIT fields  

The following fields and tabs appear in most work items. Each tab is used to track specific information, such as ![History tab icon](/vsts/work/backlogs/_img/icon-history-tab-wi.png) history, ![Links tab icon](/vsts/work/backlogs/_img/icon-links-tab-wi.png) links, or ![Attachment tab icon](/vsts/work/backlogs/_img/icon-attachments-tab-wi.png) attachments. These three tabs provide a history of changes, view of linked work items, and ability to view and attach files.  

The only required field for all WITs is **Title**. When the work item is saved, the system assigns it a unique **ID**. The form highlights required field in yellow. For information about other fields, see [Work item field index](/vsts/work/work-items/guidance/work-item-field).
