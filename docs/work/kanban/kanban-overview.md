# About Kanban and Agile project management 

[!INCLUDEÂ [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]
 
Your Kanban board provides you with a visual interactive space for you and your team to plan and show progress. With it, your team can track the critical information they need by seeing which work items are in progress, where the bottlenecks are, who work is assigned to, and more.

Each card on the board corresponds to a user story or work item the team is tracking.

Your Kanban board is fully customizable to support your team's workflow. 

The main steps you'll typically want to follow are outlined below. 

[![Configure Kanban board](../backlogs/_img/overview/gs-planning-configure-kanban.png)](kanban-basics.md)[![Update the Kanban board](../backlogs/_img/overview/gs-planning-track-kanban.png)](kanban-basics.md)[![Monitor progress](../backlogs/_img/overview/gs-planning-monitor-kanban.png)](../../report/dashboards/cumulative-flow.md)

Once you've configured your Kanban board, you can add work items directly to the board. You then update the status of work by dragging a card to another column on the Kanban board. You can even change the order of items as you move a card to a new column.
