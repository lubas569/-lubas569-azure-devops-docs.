# Query by date or current iteration

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/dev15-version-header.md)]

Two query macros help you find work items based on when changes occurred or if they belong to the current sprint. To list work items based on when they were created, closed, resolved, or changed state&mdash;use **@Today** or specify dates.  For queries that list work items based on their assignment to a team's current sprint, use **@CurrentIteration**.</p>
<p>For example, you can find work items that were modified in the last 3 days with the following query.

![Editor query filter based on recent changes](_img/query-by-date-example.png)  


##Query for items based on when changes occurred

You can filter for work items by the date on which they were changed or for a specific time period. If you limit the scope of your query, it can help with performance by only returning those results that fit the date range that you want to include. If you're new to creating queries, see [Use the query editor to list and manage queries](using-queries.md). 

Not all fields are valid for all work item types (WITs). Jump to <a href="#date_fields">date fields</a> for the set of fields you can include in queries and which WITs they apply to. Enter dates in the format accepted by your computer's operating system.

## Query for items based on belonging to a team's current iteration  
If your team follows Scrum processes, you [schedule work to be completed in sprints](../scrum/define-sprints.md). You can track the progress of requirements, bugs, and other work to be completed in the current sprint using the **@CurrentIteration** macro.  

Prior to creating or updating a query to use the **@CurrentIteration** macro, make sure you [select your team](#team_view). The **@CurrentIteration** macro references the current team selected in the web portal.  

Any item assigned to a sprint which corresponds to the current iteration path for the team will be found.  For example, if a team is on Sprint 5, then the query will return items assigned to Sprint 5. Later, when the team is working in Sprint 6, the same query will return items assigned to Sprint 6.  

![Query filter using the @CurrentIteration macro](_img/query-using-at-current-iteration-macro.png)  

You can't use the **@CurrentIteration** macro from some [clients, features, or REST APIs](#current_sprint_restrict).

## Query for items based on a sliding window of team iterations 

The <b>@CurrentIteration +/- <i>n</i></b> macro is useful for tracking work a team plans for upcoming sprints and for understanding work that wasn't completed in previous sprints. 

> [!NOTE] 
> **Feature availability**: The <b>@CurrentIteration +/- <i>n</i></b> macro is supported from the web portal for VSTS. The macro only works when run from the web portal. 

Here we show how to list all Features, User Stories, and Bugs assigned to the previous, current, and next sprints selected for the current team context and under the specified Area Path. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
![At Current Iteration plus and minus claused](_img/query-at-current-iteration-plus-minus.png)

To use this macro, a team must have [selected a set of sprints](../scale/set-team-defaults.md) that span the <b>+/- <i>n</i></b> value entered for the macro.

## Date fields
<p>You can use date fields to filter your queries. Some of these fields are populated with information as a work item progresses from one state to another. Several of these fields do not appear on the work item form, but they are tracked for those WITs listed in the following table.</p>

#### Notes:
 
1. For these fields to be defined for a WIT, they must be included in the ```WORKFLOW``` section of the WIT definition. For example, this syntax is included within the ```FIELDS``` definition when transitioning to a Resolved state:  
	```
	<FIELD refname="Microsoft.VSTS.Common.ResolvedDate />  
	   <SERVERDEFAULT from="clock"  />  
	</FIELD >  
	```

2. Start and Finish Date fields are calculated if you create a project plan in Microsoft Project and then synchronize that plan with tasks that are stored in TFS or VSTS. These fields do not appear on the work item form, but they are calculated for those backlog items and tasks that are linked to backlog items. You can view their read-only values in results from a query or from Microsoft ExcelÂ or Project. For more information, see [Create your backlog and tasks using Project](../backlogs/office/create-your-backlog-tasks-using-project.md).

###Client restrictions on the use of @CurrentIteration macro 
You can use the **@CurrentIteration** macro in a query from the following clients:  
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Web portal that connects to VSTS</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Web portal that connects to an on-premises TFS 2015 or later version</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Visual Studio 2015 or Team Explorer 2015 or later versions connected to VSTS and TFS 2015 or later versions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

An error occurs if you open a query that contains the **@CurrentIteration** macro in earlier versions of Visual Studio, or from Excel or Project. Also, you can't use the macro when [copying or cloning test suites and test cases](../../manual-test/mtm/copying-and-cloning-test-suites-and-test-cases.md), [defining alerts](../../notifications/index.md), or with [REST APIs](../../integrate/get-started/rest/basics.md).
