# Organize queries, add a query folder    

[!INCLUDEÂ [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

Organize your personal or shared queries by adding a query folder. You can then add queries to or move existing queries into those folders.
 

> [!NOTE]  
> **Feature availability**: The New Queries experience is supported on VSTS. To enable the new experience, see [Preview features](../../collaborate/preview-features.md). To learn more about the new experience, see [New Queries experience](queries-preview.md).  

## Add a query folder, move items into a folder

### Add a query to the dashboard or share it with your team 
To add a query to the home page or a dashboard, open the ![Context Menu Icon](_img/22.png) context menu for the query and [add it to a specific dashboard or as a team favorite](../../report/dashboards/dashboards.md).   

Share queries with your team by adding them to a folder under the Shared Queries space.  To save a query to a Shared Queries folder, get added to the [project administrators group](../../security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md) or have your [permissions set for a folder under Shared Queries](set-query-permissions.md). 

You can only add shared queries to dashboards or as team favorites, and only if you have [team administrator or project administrator permissions](../scale/manage-team-assets.md). 



## Q & A   
<!-- BEGINSECTION class="md-qanda" -->

### Q: Can I change the owner of a query or folder?

**A:** No. This feature was removed for TFS 2015. You can only enable permissions for users and groups from the permissions window for the query or folder.

### Q: Can I add folders to team favorites?

**A:** No. You can only add folders under My Queries and under Shared Queries.

### Q: Are the queries and folders I create from the web portal the same as in Team Explorer?

**A:** Yes. You might have to refresh your browser or client to see changes you make in another client.

### Q: Can I move a query or a folder?  

**A:** Yes. In the web portal, choose **Rename** from the context menu. In Team Explorer for Visual Studio, simply drag the folder to the new location.  

In Team Explorer for Eclipse, choose **Move** from the context menu and select the folder to which you want to move the item.
