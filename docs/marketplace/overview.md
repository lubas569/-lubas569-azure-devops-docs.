## What are extensions?

An extension is an installable unit that contributes new capabilities into Visual Studio, Azure DevOps Services, Team Foundation Server, or Visual Studio Code. You can find extensions from within these product or from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/azuredevops). 

Extending Azure DevOps Services is the easiest way for users to get the most out of their 
devops environment. The [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/azuredevops) is home to hundreds of extensions
that can be installed to help with the following:

- Planning and tracking of work items, sprints, scrums, etc.
- Build and release flows
- Code testing and tracking
- Collaboration amongst team members

Adding extensions to your organization is incredibly easy:

1. Search and find extensions for your organization in the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/azuredevops), Azure DevOps tab.
2. Install the extension from the Marketplace and start using it in Azure DevOps.

You must have administrative permissions to upload or install extensions.
