####Q:		Why can't I buy extensions from Microsoft partners?

A:	This might happen for these reasons: 

<a name="restricted-countries"></a>
*	Restricted countries

	In some countries, you can't use specific Azure subscriptions 
	to buy extensions or resources from Microsoft partners in the Visual Studio Marketplace, 
	although you can use those same subscriptions 
	to buy extensions published by Microsoft. See 
	[Who can purchase applications and services sold/provisioned through the Azure Marketplace?](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/faq/)

	If your country is supported in the Azure Marketplace, 
	but not for the extension that you want to purchase,
	please contact the extension publisher.

<a name="credit-card-required"></a>
*	Credit card required

	Unless you have an [Enterprise Agreement](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/enterprise-agreement/), 
	you must have a credit card associated with your Azure subscription. 
	For example, you can't use a Pay-As-You-Go subscription 
	that's set up for invoice billing.

	If you can't use your subscription, 
	try using creating another Pay-As-You-Go 
	Azure subscription with a credit card.

	> [!NOTE]
	> If you get this message: *"This Azure subscription 
	> doesn't have a credit card on file. 
	> Please select another subscription"*, 
	> select another subscription, 
	> or click **Create a new Azure subscription** 
	> to continue.

<a name="enterpise-agreement"></a>
*	[Enterprise Agreement](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/enterprise-agreement/) purchases
	
	To buy extensions or resources from Microsoft partners 
	in the Visual Studio Marketplace, 
	your Azure Enterprise Agreement administrator 
	must enable Azure Marketplace purchases. 
	Go to the Microsoft Azure Enterprise Portal (```https://ea.azure.com```) > 
	**Manage** > **Enrollment**, and enable **Azure Marketplace**.

	> [!NOTE]
	> If you get this message:
	> *"The ordering account is not eligible to 
	> purchase from azure store using Enterprise Agreement."*, 
	> have your Azure Enterprise Agreement administrator 
	> go to the Microsoft Azure Enterprise 
	> Portal (```https://ea.azure.com```) > **Manage** > **Enrollment**, 
	> and enable **Azure Marketplace**.

<a name="credit-card-problems"></a>
*	Credit card problems

	Purchases from Microsoft partners are charged immediately, 
	not at the end of your billing cycle, like Microsoft resources. 
	This means that if your credit card is declined for any reason, 
	your purchase won't be completed. If this happens, 
	try your purchase again, or contact your credit card customer service.

	> [!NOTE]
	> If you get this message: 
	> *"The payment provider declined the transaction. 
	> Please check your credit card information"*, 
	> try your purchase again later, 
	> or contact your credit card customer service.

<a name="mpsa"></a>
*	[Microsoft Products and Services Agreement (MPSA)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/mpsa/default.aspx)

	If you have an Azure subscription from an MPSA, 
	you can't buy resources or extensions from Microsoft partners 
	in the Visual Studio Marketplace. 
	There are no plans to support this, 
	so your best option is to set up an Azure subscription 
	that's based on a [Pay-As-You-Go](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/offers/ms-azr-0003p/), 
	[Enterprise Agreement](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/enterprise-agreement/), 
	or another Azure offer.
