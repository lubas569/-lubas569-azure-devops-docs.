#### Q: How do you bill for extension purchases or changes?

A: For Microsoft extensions:

*	Your charges are prorated during the 1st month of use. 
After that, they renew and are billed automatically on the 
1st day of the calendar month unless you cancel. 

*	If you reduce users for a paid extension, 
those decreases won't take effect until the 
1st day of the next calendar month. 
You're still charged for the users that 
you've committed for the current month.

*	If you add users for a paid extension, 
those increases will take effect immediately. 
Charges for increases are prorated, 
but only above the number of users that 
you've committed for the current month.

*	If you reduce users and add users for the same paid extension 
in the same month, you're not double-charged if you don't go above 
the number of users that you've committed for the current month.

*	If you uninstall or disable a paid extension, 
charges will continue unless you cancel the extension 
by [reducing all your users to zero (0)](/vsts/marketplace/install-vsts-extension#change-extension-quantity). 

For non-Microsoft extensions:

*	Your charges start on the day that you purchase 
and renew on the same day each month until you cancel. 

*	Changes to your user plan will be pro-rated on your next bill based on the number of days you were on each plan.

*	If you uninstall or disable a paid extension, 
charges will continue unless you cancel the extension 
by [reducing all your users to zero (0)](/vsts/marketplace/install-vsts-extension#change-extension-quantity).
