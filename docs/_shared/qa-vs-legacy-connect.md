####Q:	Can I use earlier versions of Visual Studio to connect to VSTS?

A:	Yes, you can use Visual Studio 2013 or 2012. You can also use Visual Studio 2010, 
but you'll need to install [Service Pack 1](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=23691) 
and [KB2662296](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2662296) first. Or, you can use Visual 
Studio 2008 SP1, with [this GDR update](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2673642). 
Launch Visual Studio, then connect to VSTS  
and select your team project.
