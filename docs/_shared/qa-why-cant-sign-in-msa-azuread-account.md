####Q:	Why can't I sign in after I choose either "personal Microsoft account" or "work or school account"?

A:	This happens when your sign-in address is shared by your 
personal Microsoft account and by your work account or school account, 
but your selected identity doesn't have access. 
Although both identities have the same sign-in address, 
they're still separate identities with different profiles, 
security settings, and permissions.

Please try signing out completely from VSTS by following the steps below 
because just closing your browser might not sign you out completely from VSTS. 
Then sign in again to VSTS, and select your other identity:

0.	Close all browsers, including those that aren't running VSTS.

0.	Open a private or incognito browsing session. 

0.	Go to this URL: http://aka.ms/vssignout

	You'll get a message that says "Sign out in progress". 
	After you're signed out, you're redirected to the 
	Visual Studio page @visualstudio.microsoft.com. 

	**Tip** If the sign-out page takes more than a minute, 
	close the browser, and continue.

0.	Sign in to VSTS again. 
Select your other identity.
