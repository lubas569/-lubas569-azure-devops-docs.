#### Q:	Can I create more than one project?

A:	Yes, multiple projects help you keep work separate when 
you have development projects for different teams. 
VSTS currently supports one project collection.

To create projects, you'll need VSTS 
project collection administrator or organization owner permissions. For details, see [Create a project](/vsts/organizations/projects/create-project.md). 

To learn more about projects and when or when not to add one, see [About projects and scaling your organization](/vsts/organizations/projects/about-projects.md).
