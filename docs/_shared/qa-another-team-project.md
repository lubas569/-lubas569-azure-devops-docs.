#### Q:	Can I create more than one project?

A:	Yes, multiple projects help you keep work separate when you have development projects for different teams. Azure DevOps currently supports one project collection.

To create projects, you need Azure DevOps project collection administrator or organization owner permissions. For details, see [Create a project](/azure/devops/organizations/projects/create-project.md). 

To learn more about projects and when you should or shouldn't add one, see [About projects and scaling your organization](/azure/devops/organizations/projects/about-projects.md).
