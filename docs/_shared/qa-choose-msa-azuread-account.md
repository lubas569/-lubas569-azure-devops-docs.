####Q:	Why must I choose between a "work or school account" and my "personal account"?

A:	This happens when you sign-in with an email address, 
like jamalhartnett@fabrikam.com, that's shared by your 
personal Microsoft account and by your work account or school account. 
Although both identities use the same sign-in address, 
they're still separate identities with different profiles, 
security settings, and permissions, so you see this screen when you sign in:
