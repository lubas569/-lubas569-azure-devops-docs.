####Q:  How do I find out if my VSTS account controls access with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)?

A:	If you have at least Basic access, here's how:

Go your VSTS account settings by choosing the gear cog and then **Settings**:

Check if your account controls access with Azure AD.

If your account is connected to your organization's directory, 
this means that only users from your organization's directory can join your account.
Learn about [controlling account access with Azure AD](/vsts/organizations/accounts/add-users-to-aad).
