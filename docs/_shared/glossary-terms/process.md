## Process
Defines the building blocks of the work tracking system. To customize a process, you first create an inherited process from one of the default system processes&mdash;[Agile](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/agile-process), [Scrum](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/scrum-process), or [CMMI](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/cmmi-process). Changes you make to a process are seen by all projects that use it.
