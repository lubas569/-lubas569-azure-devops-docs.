## Teams 

A team corresponds to a selected set of project members. With teams, organizations can sub-categorize work to better focus on all the work they're tracking within a project. Each team gets access to a suite of Agile tools. These tools provide teams the ability to work autonomously and collaborate with other teams across the enterprise. Each team can configure and customize each tool to meet their work requirements. Learn more: [About teams and Agile tools](/azure/devops/organizations/settings/about-teams-and-settings).
