## Area paths
Area paths allow you to group work items by team, product, or feature area. Whereas, iteration paths allow you to group work into sprints, milestones, or other event-specific or time-related period. The area path allows you to define a hierarchy of paths. Learn more: [About area and iteration paths](/azure/devops/organizations/settings/about-areas-iterations).
