Azure DevOps uses Agile as the default [process](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/choose-process) to organize your work. Your organization's default location is based on the closest [Microsoft Azure region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions) where Azure DevOps is available. For a better experience, select a location that's closest to most users in your organization. 

If a new region or location opens later, you can [change your organization location or region](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/change-organization-location). You can also select another process, like Scrum, if that works best for you.
