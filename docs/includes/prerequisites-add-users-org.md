## Prerequisites

You add users to a project or team. You add projects to organizations, and you add teams to projects.

* You must have an organization and project. If you don't have a project yet, [create one](/azure/devops/organizations/projects/create-project). 
* To add users to an organization, you must be a member of the [Project Collection Administrators group](/azure/devops/organizations/security/set-project-collection-level-permissions). Organization owners are automatically members of this group.
* To add users to a project, you must be a member of the [Project Administrators or Project Collection Administrators groups](/azure/devops/organizations/security/set-project-collection-level-permissions).   
* To add users to a team, you must be [added as a team administrator](/azure/devops/organizations/settings/add-team-administrator), or you must be a member of one of the administrative groups.  

For an overview of the methods supported for adding users to an organization, see [About organization management, Add and manage user access](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/organization-management#add-users). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're adding users to an organization in Azure DevOps Services and you don't use Azure AD, then you need to [add their "personal" Microsoft accounts to your account or project](/azure/devops/user-guide/sign-up-invite-teammates#invite-others). After you've added them to one project, you can add them to additional projects using the procedures provided in this article.
