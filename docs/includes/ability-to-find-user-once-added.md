> [!NOTE]   
> You may not be able to find a user from a permissions page or identity field if the user hasn't been added to the project&mdash;either by adding it to a security group or to a project team. Also, when a user is added to Azure Active Directory or Active Directory, there can be a delay between the time they are added to the project and when they are searchable from an identity field. The delay can be between 5 minutes to 7 days.
