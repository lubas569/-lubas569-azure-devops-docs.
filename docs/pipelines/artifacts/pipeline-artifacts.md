# Pipeline Artifacts in Azure Pipelines

**Azure Pipelines**

> [!NOTE]
> Pipeline Artifacts are the next generation of build artifacts in Azure Pipelines and are current in Preview.
> For the current artifacts, see [Build artifacts](build-artifacts.md).

Pipeline Artifacts help you store build outputs and move intermediate files between stages in your pipelines. Artifacts are the files that you want your build to produce and can be anything your team needs to test or deploy your app.

You’ll see the most benefit from Pipeline Artifacts if you have a build that produces very large build outputs. If you’re an existing Azure DevOps user, Pipeline Artifacts are automatically enabled for you.

## Publish Pipeline Artifact

In build artifacts, it was common to first copy files to `$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)` and then use the Publish Build Artifacts task to publish that directory. With Pipeline Artifacts, we recommend pointing the Publish Pipeline Artifacts tasks directly to the paths to be published. This saves your build the time of creating a copy of the files you wish to publish.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

```yaml
steps:
- task: PublishPipelineArtifact@0
  inputs:
    artifactName: 'artifactName'
    targetPath: 'src/MyWebApp/bin/Release/netcoreapp2.0/linux-x64/publish'
```

# [Designer](#tab/designer)

## Download Pipeline Artifact

> If you are using Pipeline Artifacts to deliver artifacts into a release pipeline you don’t need to add the task, release pipelines will automatically inject the task into your stages. If you want more control over how files a placed on disk, you can manually add the Download Pipeline Artifact task yourself. You can also use the task to download artifacts from a different pipeline.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

```yaml
steps:
- task: DownloadPipelineArtifact@0
  inputs:
    targetPath: $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)
```

# [Designer](#tab/designer)

![icon](../tasks/utility/_img/download-pipeline-artifact.png) **Utility: Download Pipeline Artifact**
