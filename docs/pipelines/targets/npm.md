# Publish npm packages

::: moniker range="<= tfs-2018"
[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/concept-rename-note.md)]

You can publish npm packages produced by your build to:

* The VSTS or TFS Package Management service
* Other registries such as `https://registry.npmjs.org/`

Before you read this topic, you should understand the kind of build pipeline you're creating: [designer](../get-started-designer.md) or [YAML](../get-started-yaml.md).

# [Web](#tab/web)

To publish an npm package to a Package Management feed, add the **npm** task. Then, configure these options:

- **working folder:** Select the folder that contains your `.npmrc` and `package.json`; leave blank if those files are at the root of the repo
- **npm command:** `publish`

[!INCLUDE [package management permissions](_shared/package-management-permissions-for-web-build.md)]

To publish to a external npm registry, you must first create a service connection to point to that registry. You can do this by going to **Project settings**, then choosing **Service connections**, and then creating a **New service connection**. Select the **npm** option for the service connection. Fill in registry URL and the credentials to connect to the registry.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

::: moniker range="< vsts"
YAML is not supported in TFS.

To publish to a external npm registry, you must first create a service connection to point to that feed. You can do this by going to **Project settings**, then choosing **Services**, and then creating a **New service connection**. Select the **npm** option for the service connection. Fill in registry URL and the credentials to connect to the registry.

To publish a package to a npm registry, add the following snippet to your .vsts-ci.yml file.

```yaml
- task: Npm@1
  inputs:
    command: publish
    publishEndpoint: '<copy and paste the name of the service connection here>'
```

For a list of other options, see the [npm task](../tasks/package/npm.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Build does not support using the `publishConfig` property to specify the `registry` to which you're publishing. Ensure your working folder has a `.npmrc` file with a `registry=` line, as detailed in the Connect to feed screen in your feed.
