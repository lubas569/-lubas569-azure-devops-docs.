# Build Azure Repos Git or TFS Git repositories

[!INCLUDE [version-tfs-2015-rtm](../includes/version-tfs-2015-rtm.md)]

::: moniker range="<= tfs-2018"
[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/concept-rename-note.md)]

Azure Pipelines can automatically build and validate every pull request and commit to your Azure Repos Git repository.

## Choose a repository to build

# [YAML](#tab/yaml/)

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

You create a new pipeline by first selecting a repository and then a YAML file in that repository. The repository in which the YAML file is present is called `self` repository. By default, this is the repository that your pipeline builds. 

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

You can later configure your pipeline to check out a different repository or multiple repositories. To learn how to do this, see [multi-repo checkout](multi-repo-checkout.md).

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops-2019"

YAML pipelines are not available in TFS.

::: moniker-end

# [Classic](#tab/classic/)

While creating a pipeline, to choose the repository to build, first select the project to which the repository belongs. Then, select the repository.

To clone additional repositories as part of your pipeline:

* If the repo is in the same project as your pipeline, or if the access token (explained below) has access to the repository in a different project, use the following command:

  `git clone -c http.extraheader="AUTHORIZATION: bearer $(System.AccessToken)" <clone URL>`

* If the access token (explained below) does not have access to the repository:

    1. Get a [personal access token (PAT)](../../organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate.md) with `Code (read)` scope, and prefix it with `pat:`
    2. Base64-encode this string to create a basic auth token.
    3. Add a script in your pipeline with the following command to clone that repo
       `git clone -c http.extraheader="AUTHORIZATION: basic <BASIC_AUTH_TOKEN>" <clone URL>`

---

Azure Pipelines must be granted access to your repositories to trigger their builds and fetch their code during builds. Normally, a pipeline has access to repositories in the same project. But, if you wish to access repositories in a different project, then you need to update the permissions granted to [job access tokens](../process/access-tokens.md).

## CI triggers

Continuous integration (CI) triggers cause a pipeline to run whenever you push an update to the specified branches or you push  specified tags.

### Skipping CI for individual commits

::: moniker range="<= azure-devops-2019"

You can also tell Azure Pipelines to skip running a pipeline that a commit would normally trigger. Just include `***NO_CI***` in the commit message of the HEAD commit and Azure Pipelines will skip running CI.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="> azure-devops-2019"

You can also tell Azure Pipelines to skip running a pipeline that a commit would normally trigger. Just include `[skip ci]` in the commit message or description of the HEAD commit and Azure Pipelines will skip running CI. You can also use any of the variations below.

- `[skip ci]` or `[ci skip]`
- `skip-checks: true` or `skip-checks:true`
- `[skip azurepipelines]` or `[azurepipelines skip]`
- `[skip azpipelines]` or `[azpipelines skip]`
- `[skip azp]` or `[azp skip]`
- `***NO_CI***`

[!INCLUDE [ci-triggers](includes/ci-triggers5.md)]

## PR triggers

Pull request (PR) triggers cause a build to run whenever a pull request is opened with one of the specified target branches, or when changes are pushed to such a pull request. In Azure Repos Git, this functionality is implemented using branch policies. To enable pull request validation in Azure Git Repos, navigate to the branch policies for the desired branch, and configure the [Build validation policy](../../repos/git/branch-policies.md#build-validation) for that branch. For more information, see [Configure branch policies](../../repos/git/branch-policies.md).

>[!NOTE]
>To configure validation builds for an Azure Repos Git repository, you must be a project administrator of its project.

::: moniker range=">tfs-2018"

### Validate contributions from forks

Building pull requests from Azure Repos forks is no different from building pull requests within the same repository or project. You can create forks only within the same organization that your project is part of.

## Pricing

Azure Pipelines is free for Azure Repos Git repositories, with multiple free offerings available depending on whether your Azure DevOps project is public or private.

If your Azure Repos Git repository is open source, you can make your Azure DevOps project **public** so that anyone can view your pipeline's build results, logs, and test results without signing in. When users submit pull requests, they can view the status of builds that automatically validate those pull requests.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Repos Git repositories do not support forks by users who do not have explicit access to the project.

If your project is public, you can run up to 10 parallel jobs in Azure Pipelines for free. These free jobs have a maximum timeout of 360 minutes (6 hours) each. If your project is private, we still provide a free tier. In this tier, you can run one free parallel job that can run up to 60 minutes each time until you've used 1800 minutes per month. For more information, see [parallel jobs](../licensing/concurrent-jobs.md).

For more information on public projects, see [Create a public project](../../organizations/public/create-public-project.md).

## Q & A

### I see the following permission error in the log file during checkout step. How do I fix it?

```log
remote: TF401019: The Git repository with name or identifier XYZ does not exist or you do not have permissions for the operation you are attempting.
fatal: repository 'XYZ' not found
##[error]Git fetch failed with exit code: 128
```

* First, check if the repository still exists.
* Determine the [job authorization scope](../process/access-tokens.md#q-a) of the pipeline.
  * If the scope is **collection**: 
    * This may be an intermittent error. Re-run the pipeline.
    * Someone may have removed the access to **Project Collection Build Service account**.
      * Go to the **project settings** of the project in which the repository exists. Select Repos -> Repositories -> specific repository.
      * Check if **Project Collection Build Service (your-collection-name)** exists in the list of users.
      * Check if that account has **Create tag** and **Read** access.
  * If the scope is **project**: 
    * Is the repo in the same project as the pipeline?
      * Yes: 
        * This may be an intermittent error. Re-run the pipeline.
        * Someone may have removed the access to **Project Build Service account**.
          * Go to the **project settings** of the project in which the repository exists. Select Repos -> Repositories -> specific repository.
          * Check if **your-project-name Build Service (your-collection-name)** exists in the list of users.
          * Check if that account has **Create tag** and **Read** access.
      * No:
        * Is your pipeline in a public project?
          * Yes: You cannot access resources outside of your public project. Make the project private.
          * No: You need to take additional steps to grant access. Let us say that your pipeline exists in project **A** and that your repository exists in project **B**.
            * Go to the project settings of the project in which the repository exists (B). Select Repos -> Repositories -> specific repository.
            * Add **your-project-name Build Service (your-collection-name)** to the list of users, where your-project-name is the name of the project in which your pipeline exists (A).
            * Give **Create tag** and **Read** access to the account.
