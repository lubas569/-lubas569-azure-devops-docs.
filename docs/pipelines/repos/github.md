# Build GitHub repositories

[!INCLUDE [version-team-services](../includes/version-team-services.md)]

Azure Pipelines can automatically build and validate every pull request and commit to your GitHub repository. This article describes how to configure the integration between GitHub and Azure Pipelines.

If you're new to Azure Pipelines integration with GitHub, follow the steps in [Create your first pipeline](../create-first-pipeline.md) to get your first pipeline working with a GitHub repository, and then come back to this article to learn more about configuring and customizing the integration between GitHub and Azure Pipelines.

## Map organizations and users

GitHub and Azure Pipelines are two independent services that integrate well together. Each of them have their own organization and user management. This section explains how to replicate the organization and users from GitHub to Azure Pipelines.

### Organizations

GitHub's structure consists of **organizations and user accounts** that contain **repositories**. See [GitHub's documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/differences-between-user-and-organization-accounts/).

![GitHub organization structure](media/github-org-structure.png)

Azure DevOps' structure consists of **organizations** that contain **projects**. See [Plan your organizational structure](../../user-guide/plan-your-azure-devops-org-structure.md).

![Azure DevOps organization structure](media/azure-devops-org-structure.png)

Azure DevOps can reflect your GitHub structure with:
* An Azure DevOps **organization** for your GitHub **organization or user account**
* Azure DevOps **projects** for your GitHub **repositories**

![GitHub structure mapped to Azure DevOps](media/github-structure-mapped-to-azure-devops.png)

To set up this mapping between GitHub and Azure DevOps:

1. Create an Azure DevOps organization named after your GitHub organization or user account. It will have a URL like `https://dev.azure.com/your-organization`.
1. In the Azure DevOps organization, create projects named after your repositories. They will have URLs like `https://dev.azure.com/your-organization/your-repository`.
1. In the Azure DevOps projects, create pipelines named after the GitHub organization and repository they build, such as `your-organization.your-repository`. Then, it's clear which repositories they're for.

Following this pattern, your GitHub repositories and Azure DevOps projects will have matching URL paths. For example:

|              |                                        |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| GitHub       | `https://github.com/python/cpython`    |
| Azure DevOps | `https://dev.azure.com/python/cpython` |

### Users

Your GitHub users do not automatically get access to Azure Pipelines. You must add your GitHub users explicitly to Azure Pipelines.

GitHub permissions on GitHub organizations, user accounts, and repositories can be reflected in Azure DevOps.

#### Map GitHub organization roles

GitHub organization member roles are found at `https://github.com/orgs/your-organization/people` (replace `your-organization`).

Azure DevOps organization member permissions are found at `https://dev.azure.com/your-organization/_settings/security` (replace `your-organization`).

GitHub organization roles map to Azure DevOps organization permissions as follows.

| GitHub organization role | Azure DevOps organization equivalent          |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Owner                    | Member of `Project Collection Administrators` |
| Billing manager          | Member of `Project Collection Administrators` |
| Member                   | Member of `Project Collection Valid Users`. By default, this group lacks permission to create new projects. To change this, set the group's `Create new projects` permission to `Allow`, or create a new group with permissions you need. |

#### Map GitHub user account roles

A GitHub user account has one role, which is ownership of the account.

Azure DevOps organization member permissions are found at `https://dev.azure.com/your-organization/_settings/security` (replace `your-organization`).

The GitHub user account role maps to Azure DevOps organization permissions as follows.

| GitHub user account role | Azure DevOps organization equivalent          |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Owner                    | Member of `Project Collection Administrators` |

#### Map GitHub repository permissions

GitHub repository permissions are found at `https://github.com/your-organization/your-repository/settings/collaboration` (replace `your-organization` and `your-repository`).

Azure DevOps project permissions are found at `https://dev.azure.com/your-organization/your-project/_settings/security` (replace `your-organization` and `your-project`).

GitHub repository permissions map to Azure DevOps project permissions as follows.

| GitHub repository permission | Azure DevOps project equivalent    |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Admin                        | Member of `Project Administrators` |
| Write                        | Member of `Contributors`           |
| Read                         | Member of `Readers`                |

If your GitHub repository grants permission to teams, you can create matching teams in the `Teams` section of your Azure DevOps project settings. Then, add the teams to the security groups above, just like users.

#### Pipeline-specific permissions

To grant permissions to users or teams for specific pipelines in an Azure DevOps project, follow these steps:

1. Visit the project's Pipelines page (for example, `https://dev.azure.com/your-organization/your-project/_build`).
1. Select the pipeline for which to set specific permissions.
1. From the '**...**' context menu, select **Security**.
1. Click **Add...** to add a specific user, team, or group and customize their permissions for the pipeline.

## Choose a repository to build

# [YAML](#tab/yaml/)

You create a new pipeline by first selecting a GitHub repository and then a YAML file in that repository. The repository in which the YAML file is present is called `self` repository. By default, this is the repository that your pipeline builds. 

You can later configure your pipeline to check out a different repository or multiple repositories. To learn how to do this, see [multi-repo checkout](multi-repo-checkout.md).

# [Classic](#tab/classic/)

You create a new pipeline by first selecting **GitHub** for repository type, and then one of the repositories you have access to.

---

Azure Pipelines must be granted access to your repositories to trigger their builds, and fetch their code during builds.

There are 3 authentication types for granting Azure Pipelines access to your GitHub repositories while creating a pipeline.

| Authentication type            | Pipelines run using              | Works with [GitHub Checks](https://developer.github.com/v3/checks/) |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----|
| 1. [GitHub App](#github-app-authentication) | The Azure Pipelines identity  | Yes |
| 2. [OAuth](#oauth-authentication)           | Your personal GitHub identity | No  |
| 3. [Personal access token (PAT)](#personal-access-token-pat-authentication) | Your personal GitHub identity | No  |

### GitHub app authentication

The Azure Pipelines GitHub App is the **recommended** authentication type for continuous integration pipelines. By installing the GitHub App in your GitHub account or organization, your pipeline can run without using your personal GitHub identity. Builds and GitHub status updates will be performed using the Azure Pipelines identity. The app works with [GitHub Checks](https://developer.github.com/v3/checks/) to display build, test, and code coverage results in GitHub.

To use the GitHub App, install it in your GitHub organization or user account for some or all repositories. The GitHub App can be installed and uninstalled from the app's [homepage](https://github.com/apps/azure-pipelines).

After installation, the GitHub App will become Azure Pipelines' default method of authentication to GitHub (instead of OAuth) when pipelines are created for the repositories.

If you install the GitHub App for all repositories in a GitHub organization, you don't need to worry about Azure Pipelines sending mass emails or automatically setting up pipelines on your behalf. As an alternative to installing the app for all repositories, repository admins can install it one at a time for individual repositories. This requires more work for admins, but has no advantage nor disadvantage.

#### Permissions needed in GitHub

Installation of Azure Pipelines GitHub app requires you to be a GitHub organization owner or repository admin. In addition, to create a pipeline for a GitHub repository with continuous integration and pull request triggers, you must have the required GitHub permissions configured. Otherwise, **the repository will not appear** in the repository list while creating a pipeline. Depending on the authentication type and ownership of the repository, ensure that the appropriate access is configured.

- If the repo is in your personal GitHub account, install the Azure Pipelines GitHub App in your personal GitHub account. You will be able to list this repository when create the pipeline in Azure Pipelines.

- If the repo is in someone else's personal GitHub account, the other person must install the Azure Pipelines GitHub App in their personal GitHub account. You must be added as a collaborator in the repository's settings under "Collaborators". Accept the invitation to be a collaborator using the link that is emailed to you. Once you have done so, you can create a pipeline for that repository.

- If the repo is in a GitHub organization that you own, install the Azure Pipelines GitHub App in the GitHub organization. You must also be added as a collaborator, or your team must be added, in the repository's settings under "Collaborators and teams". 

- If the repo is in a GitHub organization that someone else owns, a GitHub organization owner or repository admin must install the Azure Pipelines GitHub App in the organization. You must be added as a collaborator, or your team must be added, in the repository's settings under "Collaborators and teams". Accept the invitation to be a collaborator using the link that is emailed to you.

#### GitHub App permissions

The GitHub App requests the following permissions during installation:

| Permission | What Azure Pipelines does with it |
|------------|-----------------------------------|
| Write access to code | Only upon your deliberate action, Azure Pipelines will simplify creating a pipeline by committing a YAML file to a selected branch of your GitHub repository. |
| Read access to metadata | Azure Pipelines will retrieve GitHub metadata for displaying the repository, branches, and issues associated with a build in the build's summary. |
| Read and write access to checks | Azure Pipelines will read and write its own build, test, and code coverage results to be displayed in GitHub. |
| Read and write access to pull requests | Only upon your deliberate action, Azure Pipelines will simplify creating a pipeline by creating a pull request for a YAML file that was committed to a selected branch of your GitHub repository. Azure Pipelines will retrieve pull request metadata to display in build summaries associated with pull requests. |

<!--
Detailed permissions not displayed to the user during installation:
| Checks (read & write)
| Repository contents (read & write)
| Deployments (read & write)
| Issues (read & write)
| Repository metadata (read)
| Pull requests (read & write)
| Commit statuses (read & write)
 -->

#### Troubleshooting GitHub App installation

GitHub may display an error such as:

`You do not have permission to modify this app on your-organization. Please contact an Organization Owner.`

This means that the GitHub App is likely already installed for your organization. When you create a pipeline for a repository in the organization, the GitHub App will automatically be used to connect to GitHub.

#### Create pipelines in multiple Azure DevOps organizations and projects

Once the GitHub App is installed, pipelines can be created for the organization's repositories in different Azure DevOps organizations and projects. However, if you create pipelines for a single repository in multiple Azure DevOps organizations, only the first organization's pipelines can be automatically triggered by GitHub commits or pull requests. Manual or scheduled builds are still possible in secondary Azure DevOps organizations.

### OAuth authentication

[OAuth](https://help.github.com/articles/authorizing-oauth-apps/) is the simplest authentication type to get started with for repositories in your personal GitHub account. GitHub status updates will be performed on behalf of your personal GitHub identity. For pipelines to keep working, your repository access must remain active. Some GitHub features, like Checks, are unavailable with OAuth and require the GitHub App.

To use OAuth, click **Choose a different connection** below the list of repositories while creating a pipeline. Then, click **Authorize** to sign into GitHub and authorize with OAuth. An OAuth connection will be saved in your Azure DevOps project for later use, as well as used in the pipeline being created.

#### Permissions needed in GitHub

To create a pipeline for a GitHub repository with continuous integration and pull request triggers, you must have the required GitHub permissions configured. Otherwise, **the repository will not appear** in the repository list while creating a pipeline. Depending on the authentication type and ownership of the repository, ensure that the appropriate access is configured.

- If the repo is in your personal GitHub account, at least once, authenticate to GitHub with OAuth using your personal GitHub account credentials. This can be done in Azure DevOps project settings under Pipelines > Service connections > New service connection > GitHub > Authorize. Grant Azure Pipelines access to your repositories under "Permissions" [here](https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/0d4949be3b947c3ce4a5).

- If the repo is in someone else's personal GitHub account, at least once, the other person must authenticate to GitHub with OAuth using their personal GitHub account credentials. This can be done in Azure DevOps project settings under Pipelines > Service connections > New service connection > GitHub > Authorize. The other person must grant Azure Pipelines access to their repositories under "Permissions" [here](https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/0d4949be3b947c3ce4a5). You must be added as a collaborator in the repository's settings under "Collaborators". Accept the invitation to be a collaborator using the link that is emailed to you.

- If the repo is in a GitHub organization that you own, at least once, authenticate to GitHub with OAuth using your personal GitHub account credentials. This can be done in Azure DevOps project settings under Pipelines > Service connections > New service connection > GitHub > Authorize. Grant Azure Pipelines access to your organization under "Organization access" [here](https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/0d4949be3b947c3ce4a5). You must be added as a collaborator, or your team must be added, in the repository's settings under "Collaborators and teams". 

- If the repo is in a GitHub organization that someone else owns, at least once, a GitHub organization owner must authenticate to GitHub with OAuth using their personal GitHub account credentials. This can be done in Azure DevOps project settings under Pipelines > Service connections > New service connection > GitHub > Authorize. The organization owner must grant Azure Pipelines access to the organization under "Organization access" [here](https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/0d4949be3b947c3ce4a5). You must be added as a collaborator, or your team must be added, in the repository's settings under "Collaborators and teams". Accept the invitation to be a collaborator using the link that is emailed to you.

#### Revoke OAuth access

After authorizing Azure Pipelines to use OAuth, to later revoke it and prevent further use, visit [OAuth Apps](https://github.com/settings/developers) in your GitHub settings. You can also delete it from the list of GitHub [service connections](../library/service-endpoints.md) in your Azure DevOps project settings.

### Personal access token (PAT) authentication

[PATs](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/) are effectively the same as OAuth, but allow you to control which permissions are granted to Azure Pipelines. Builds and GitHub status updates will be performed on behalf of your personal GitHub identity. For builds to keep working, your repository access must remain active.

To create a PAT, visit [Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) in your GitHub settings.
The required permissions are `repo`, `admin:repo_hook`, `read:user`, and `user:email`. These are the same permissions required when using OAuth above. Copy the generated PAT to the clipboard and paste it into a new GitHub [service connection](../library/service-endpoints.md) in your Azure DevOps project settings.
For future recall, name the service connection after your GitHub username. It will be available in your Azure DevOps project for later use when creating pipelines.

#### Permissions needed in GitHub

To create a pipeline for a GitHub repository with continuous integration and pull request triggers, you must have the required GitHub permissions configured. Otherwise, **the repository will not appear** in the repository list while creating a pipeline. Depending on the authentication type and ownership of the repository, ensure that the following access is configured.

- If the repo is in your personal GitHub account, the PAT must have the required access scopes under [Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens): `repo`, `admin:repo_hook`, `read:user`, and `user:email`.

- If the repo is in someone else's personal GitHub account, the PAT must have the required access scopes under [Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens): `repo`, `admin:repo_hook`, `read:user`, and `user:email`. You must be added as a collaborator in the repository's settings under "Collaborators". Accept the invitation to be a collaborator using the link that is emailed to you.

- If the repo is in a GitHub organization that you own, the PAT must have the required access scopes under [Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens): `repo`, `admin:repo_hook`, `read:user`, and `user:email`. You must be added as a collaborator, or your team must be added, in the repository's settings under "Collaborators and teams". 

- If the repo is in a GitHub organization that someone else owns, the PAT must have the required access scopes under [Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens): `repo`, `admin:repo_hook`, `read:user`, and `user:email`. You must be added as a collaborator, or your team must be added, in the repository's settings under "Collaborators and teams". Accept the invitation to be a collaborator using the link that is emailed to you.

#### Revoke PAT access

After authorizing Azure Pipelines to use a PAT, to later delete it and prevent further use, visit [Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) in your GitHub settings. You can also delete it from the list of GitHub [service connections](../library/service-endpoints.md) in your Azure DevOps project settings.

## CI triggers

Continuous integration (CI) triggers cause a pipeline to run whenever you push an update to the specified branches or you push  specified tags.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml/)

[!INCLUDE [ci-triggers](includes/ci-triggers1.md)]

[!INCLUDE [ci-triggers](includes/ci-triggers2.md)]

[!INCLUDE [ci-triggers](includes/ci-triggers3.md)]

# [Classic](#tab/classic/)

[!INCLUDE [ci-triggers](includes/ci-triggers4.md)]

![ci trigger git branches](media/ci-trigger-git-branches-neweditor.png)

---

### Skipping CI for individual commits

You can also tell Azure Pipelines to skip running a pipeline that a commit would normally trigger. Just include `[skip ci]` in the commit message or description of the HEAD commit and Azure Pipelines will skip running CI. You can also use any of the variations below.

- `[skip ci]` or `[ci skip]`
- `skip-checks: true` or `skip-checks:true`
- `[skip azurepipelines]` or `[azurepipelines skip]`
- `[skip azpipelines]` or `[azpipelines skip]`
- `[skip azp]` or `[azp skip]`
- `***NO_CI***`

[!INCLUDE [ci-triggers](includes/ci-triggers5.md)]

## PR triggers

Pull request (PR) triggers cause a pipeline to run whenever a pull request is opened with one of the specified target branches,
or when updates are made to such a pull request.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml/)

### Branches

You can specify the target branches when validating your pull requests.
For example, to validate pull requests that
target `master` and `releases/*`, you can use the following `pr` trigger. 

```yaml
pr:
- master
- releases/*
```

This configuration starts a new run the first time a new pull request is created, and after every update made to the pull request.

You can specify the full name of the branch (for example, `master`) or a wildcard (for example, `releases/*`).

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot use [variables](../process/variables.md) in triggers, as variables are evaluated at runtime (after the trigger has fired).

> [!NOTE]
> If you use [templates](../process/templates.md) to author YAML files, then you can only specify triggers in the main YAML file for the pipeline. You cannot specify triggers in the template files.

GitHub creates a new _ref_ when a pull request is created. The ref points to a _merge commit_, which is the merged code between the source and target branches of the pull request. The PR validation pipeline builds the commit this ref points to. This means that the YAML file that is used to run the pipeline is also a merge between the source and the target branch. As a result, the changes you make to the YAML file in source branch of the pull request can override the behavior defined by the YAML file in target branch.

If no `pr` triggers appear in your YAML file, pull request validations are automatically enabled for all 
branches, as if you wrote the following `pr` trigger. This configuration triggers a build when any 
pull request is created, and when commits come into the source branch of any active pull request.

```yaml
pr:
  branches:
    include:
    - '*'  # must quote since "*" is a YAML reserved character; we want a string
```

>[!IMPORTANT]
>When you specify a `pr` trigger, it replaces the default implicit `pr` trigger, and only pushes to branches that are explicitly configured to be included will trigger a pipeline.

For more complex triggers that need to exclude certain branches, you must use the full syntax as shown in the following example.

```yaml
# specific branch
pr:
  branches:
    include:
    - master
    - releases/*
    exclude:
    - releases/old*
```

### Paths

You can specify file paths to include or exclude. For example:

```yaml
# specific path
pr:
  branches:
    include:
    - master
    - releases/*
  paths:
    include:
    - docs/*
    exclude:
    - docs/README.md
```

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot use [variables](../process/variables.md) in paths, as variables are evaluated at runtime (after the trigger has fired).

### Multiple PR updates

You can specify whether additional updates to a PR should cancel in-progress validation runs for the same PR. The default is `true`.

```yaml
# auto cancel false
pr:
  autoCancel: false
  branches:
    include:
    - master
```

### Opting out of PR validation

You can opt out of pull request validation entirely by specifying `pr: none`.

```yaml
# no PR triggers
pr: none
```

For more information, see [PR trigger](../yaml-schema.md#pr-trigger) in the [YAML schema](../yaml-schema.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If your `pr` trigger isn't firing, ensure that you have not overridden YAML PR triggers in the UI.

# [Classic](#tab/classic/)

Select the **Pull request validation** trigger and check the **Enable pull request validation** check box to enable builds on pull requests.

![Pull request trigger](media/github-pr-validation-trigger.png)

You can specify branches to include and exclude.
Select a branch name from the drop-down menu and select **Include** or **Exclude** as appropriate.
For included branches, a build will be triggered on each push to a pull request targeting that branch.

---

### Accepting contributions from external sources

If your GitHub repository is open source, you can make your Azure DevOps project [public](../../organizations/public/create-public-project.md) so that anyone can view your pipeline's build results, logs, and test results without signing in. When users outside your organization fork your repository and submit pull requests, they can view the status of builds that automatically validate those pull requests.

You should keep in mind the following considerations when using Azure Pipelines in a public project when accepting contributions from external sources.

* [Access restrictions](#access-restrictions)
* [Validate contributions from forks](#validate-contributions-from-forks)
* [Important security considerations](#important-security-considerations)

#### Access restrictions

Be aware of the following access restrictions when you're running pipelines in Azure DevOps public projects:

* **Secrets:** By default, secrets associated with your pipeline are not made available to pull request validations of forks. See [Validate contributions from forks](#validate-contributions-from-forks).
* **Cross-project access:** All pipelines in an Azure DevOps public project run with an access token restricted to the project. Pipelines in a public project can access resources such as build artifacts or test results only within the project and not in other projects of the Azure DevOps organization.
* **Azure Artifacts packages:** If your pipelines need access to packages from Azure Artifacts, you must explicitly grant permission to the **Project Build Service** account to access the package feeds.

#### Validate contributions from forks

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These settings affect the security of your pipeline.

When you create a pipeline, it is automatically triggered for pull requests from forks of your repository. You can change this behavior, carefully considering how it affects security. To enable or disable this behavior:

1. Go to your Azure DevOps project. Select **Pipelines**, locate your pipeline, and select **Edit**.
2. Select the **Triggers** tab. After enabling the **Pull request trigger**, enable or disable the **Build pull requests from forks of this repository** check box.

By default with GitHub pipelines, secrets associated with your build pipeline are not made available to pull request builds of forks. These secrets are enabled by default with GitHub Enterprise Server pipelines. Secrets include:

* A security token with access to your GitHub repository.
* These items, if your pipeline uses them:
  * [Service connection](../library/service-endpoints.md) credentials
  * Files from the [secure files library](../library/secure-files.md)
  * Build [variables](../process/variables.md#secret-variables) marked **secret**

To bypass this precaution on GitHub pipelines, enable the **Make secrets available to builds of forks** check box. Be aware of this setting's effect on security.

#### Important security considerations

A GitHub user can fork your repository, change it, and create a pull request to propose changes to your repository. This pull request could contain malicious code to run as part of your triggered build. For example, an ill-intentioned script or unit test change might leak secrets or compromise the agent machine that's performing the build. We recommend the following actions to address this risk:

* Do not enable the **Make secrets available to builds of forks** check box if your repository is public or untrusted users can submit pull requests that automatically trigger builds. Otherwise, secrets might leak during a build.

* Use a [Microsoft-hosted agent pool](../agents/hosted.md) to build pull requests from forks. Microsoft-hosted agent machines are immediately deleted after they complete a build, so there is no lasting impact if they're compromised.

* If you must use a [self-hosted agent](../agents/agents.md#install), do not store any secrets or perform other builds and releases that use secrets on the same agent, unless your repository is private and you trust pull request creators. Otherwise, secrets might leak, and the repository contents or secrets of other builds and releases might be revealed.

## Comment triggers

Repository collaborators can comment on a pull request to manually run a pipeline. You might use this to run an optional test suite or validation build. The following commands can be issued to Azure Pipelines in comments:

| Command | Result |
| - | - |
| `/AzurePipelines help` | Display help for all supported commands. |
| `/AzurePipelines help <command-name>` | Display help for the specified command. |
| `/AzurePipelines run` | Run all pipelines that are associated with this repository and whose triggers do not exclude this pull request. |
| `/AzurePipelines run <pipeline-name>` | Run the specified pipeline unless its triggers exclude this pull request. |

> [!Note]
> For brevity, you can comment using `/azp` instead of `/AzurePipelines`.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Responses to these commands will appear in the pull request discussion only if your pipeline uses the [Azure Pipelines GitHub App](#github-app-authentication).

### Run pull request validation only when authorized by your team

You may not want to automatically build pull requests from unknown users until their changes can be reviewed. You can configure Azure Pipelines to build GitHub pull requests only when authorized by your team.

To enable this, in Azure Pipelines, select the **Triggers** tab in your pipeline's settings. Then, under **Pull request validation**, enable **Only trigger builds for collaborators' pull request comments** and save the pipeline. Now, the pull request validation build will not be triggered automatically. Only repository owners and collaborators with 'Write' permission can trigger the build by commenting on the pull request with `/AzurePipelines run` or `/AzurePipelines run <pipeline-name>` as described above.

### Troubleshoot pull request comment triggers

If you have the necessary repository permissions, but pipelines aren't getting triggered by your comments, make sure that your membership is **public** in the repository's organization, or directly add yourself as a repository collaborator. Azure Pipelines cannot see private organization members unless they are direct collaborators or belong to a team that is a direct collaborator. You can change your GitHub organization membership from private to public here (replace `Your-Organization` with your organization name): `https://github.com/orgs/Your-Organization/people`.

[!INCLUDE [ci-triggers](includes/source-options.md)]

## GitHub Checks

If you're using [GitHub app authentication](#github-app-authentication) for your Azure Pipelines integration with GitHub, you can use your pipeline's build results with [GitHub Checks](https://developer.github.com/v3/checks/) to help protect your branches.

You can run a validation build with each commit or pull request that targets a branch, and even prevent pull requests from merging until a validation build succeeds.

To configure mandatory validation builds for a GitHub repository, you must be its owner, a collaborator with the Admin role, or a GitHub organization member with the Write role.

1. First, create a pipeline for the repository and build it at least once so that its status is posted to GitHub, thereby making GitHub aware of the pipeline's name.

2. Next, follow GitHub's documentation for [configuring protected branches](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-protected-branches/) in the repository's settings.

   For the status check, select the name of your pipeline in the **Status checks** list.

   ![GitHub pipeline status check](media/github/github-pipeline-status-check.png)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>If your pipeline doesn't show up in this list, please ensure the following:
>
>* You are using [GitHub app authentication](#github-app-authentication)
>* Your pipeline has run at least once in the last week

## Pricing

Azure Pipelines is free for GitHub repositories, with multiple free offerings available depending on whether your GitHub repository and project are public or private.

If your GitHub repository is open source, you can make your Azure DevOps project **public** so that anyone can view your pipeline's build results, logs, and test results without signing in. When users outside your organization fork your repository and submit pull requests, they can view the status of builds that automatically validate those pull requests. If both your GitHub repository and your pipeline are public, you can run up to 10 parallel jobs in Azure Pipelines for free. These free jobs have a maximum timeout of 360 minutes (6 hours) each.

If either your GitHub repository or your pipeline is private, we still provide a free tier. In this tier, you can run one free parallel job that can run up to 60 minutes each time until you've used 1800 minutes per month. When the free tier is no longer sufficient, you can purchase additional Microsoft-hosted parallel jobs.

Learn more about pricing based on [parallel jobs](../licensing/concurrent-jobs.md).

## Q & A

### Why isn't a GitHub repository displayed for me to choose in Azure Pipelines?

Depending on the authentication type and ownership of the repository, specific permissions are required.

- If you're using the GitHub App, see [GitHub App authentication](#github-app-authentication).
- If you're using OAuth, see [OAuth authentication](#oauth-authentication).
- If you're using PATs, see [Personal access token (PAT) authentication](#personal-access-token-pat-authentication).

### How do I know the type of GitHub connection I'm using for my pipeline?

- Open the editor for the pipeline.
- Select **Triggers** to open the classic editor for the pipeline. Then, select **YAML** tab and then the **Get sources** step.
- You'll notice a banner **Authorized using connection:** indicating the service connection that was used to integrate the pipeline with GitHub.
- The name of the service connection is a hyperlink. Select it to navigate to the service connection properties.
- The properties of the service connection will indicate the type of connection being used:
  - **azure pipelines app** indicates GitHub app connection
  - **oauth** indicates OAuth connection
  - **personalaccesstoken** indicates PAT authentication

### I understand that the GitHub app is the recommended integration with Azure Pipelines. How do I switch my classic build pipeline to use GitHub app instead of OAuth?

- Navigate [here](https://github.com/apps/azure-pipelines) and install the app in the GitHub organization of your repository.
- During installation, you'll be redirected to Azure DevOps to choose an Azure DevOps organization and project. Choose the organization and project that contain the classic build pipeline you want to use the app for. This choice associates the GitHub App installation with your Azure DevOps organization. If you choose incorrectly, you can visit [this page](https://github.com/apps/azure-pipelines) to uninstall the GitHub app from your GitHub org and start over.
- In the next page that appears, you do not need to proceed creating a new pipeline.
- Edit your pipeline by visiting the Pipelines page (e.g., https:\//dev.azure.com/YOUR_ORG_NAME/YOUR_PROJECT_NAME/_build), selecting your pipeline, and clicking Edit.
- Select the "Get sources" step in the pipeline.
- On the green bar with text "Authorized using connection", click "Change" and select the GitHub App connection with the same name as the GitHub organization in which you installed the app.
- On the toolbar, select "Save and queue" and then "Save and queue". Click the link to the pipeline run that was queued to make sure it succeeds.
- Create (or close and reopen) a pull request in your GitHub repository to verify that a build is successfully queued in its "Checks" section.

### I am using the GitHub app. However, my pipeline is not being triggered when I push an update to the repository. How do I diagnose this problem?

- Verify that the mapping between the GitHub org and Azure DevOps org has been set up correctly using the app. Open a pull request in your GitHub repository, and make the comment `/azp where`. This reports back the Azure DevOps organization that the repository is mapped to. If nothing is reported back, then the app hasn't been installed or mapped correctly to an Azure DevOps organization.

- If your app has not been set up with the correct mapping, verify that you installed the GitHub app for your repository. Go to `https://github.com/<org_name>/<repo_name>/settings/installations` to check whether the app is installed for your repo.

- Verify that you have a service connection for the GitHub app in your Azure DevOps org. Go to Project Settings, then to the Service connections page. Look for a GitHub service connection with the same name as your GitHub org. Under the information section it should say "using azure pipelines app".

- Verify that your pipeline is using the GitHub app service connection. Edit the pipeline and select the Get sources step if you have a classic pipeline. If you have a YAML pipeline, select the Triggers option to go to the classic editor, and then review the Get sources step. Verify that you are using the same GitHub app's service connection from the previous step.

- Do you have another pipeline in a different Azure DevOps organization for the same repository? We currently have the limitation that we can only map a GitHub repo to a single DevOps org. Only the pipelines in the first Azure DevOps org can be automatically triggered.

### I am using OAuth for integrating Azure Pipelines with GitHub. My pipeline is not being triggered when I push an update to the repository. How do I diagnose this problem?

- Verify that you have a valid OAuth service connection in your Azure DevOps org. Go to Project Settings, then to the Service connections page. Look for the GitHub service connection that you use to connect Azure Pipelines to GitHub. Click on 'Verify Connection' and ensure that it is functional.

- Verify that your pipeline is using the correct service connection. Edit the pipeline and select the Get sources step if you have a classic pipeline. If you have a YAML pipeline, select the Triggers option to go to the classic editor, and then review the Get sources step. Verify that you are using the same service connection from the previous step.

- GitHub records any webhook payloads sent in the last hour, and the response it received when it was sent out. In GitHub, navigate to the settings for your repository, then to Webhooks, and verify that the payload that corresponds to the user's commit exists and was sent successfully to Azure DevOps.
