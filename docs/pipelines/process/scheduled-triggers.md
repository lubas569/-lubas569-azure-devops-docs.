# Configure schedules for pipelines

::: moniker range="<= tfs-2018"
[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/concept-rename-note.md)]
::: moniker-end

You can configure a pipeline to run on a schedule.

#### [YAML](#tab/yaml/)
::: moniker range="> azure-devops-2019"

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Scheduled triggers defined using the pipeline settings UI take precedence over YAML scheduled triggers.
> 
> If your YAML pipeline has both YAML scheduled triggers and UI defined scheduled triggers, 
> only the UI defined scheduled triggers are run. 
> To run the YAML defined scheduled triggers in your YAML pipeline,
> you must remove the scheduled triggers defined in the pipeline setting UI.
> Once all UI scheduled triggers are removed, a push must be made in order for the YAML 
> scheduled triggers to start running.

Scheduled triggers cause a pipeline to run on a schedule defined using [cron syntax](#supported-cron-syntax).

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to run your pipeline by only using scheduled triggers, you must disable PR and continuous integration triggers by specifying `pr: none` and `trigger: none` in your YAML file. If you're using Azure Repos Git, PR builds are configured using [branch policy](../repos/azure-repos-git.md#pr-triggers) and must be disabled there.

```yaml
schedules:
- cron: string # cron syntax defining a schedule
  displayName: string # friendly name given to a specific schedule
  branches:
    include: [ string ] # which branches the schedule applies to
    exclude: [ string ] # which branches to exclude from the schedule
  always: boolean # whether to always run the pipeline or only if there have been source code changes since the last successful scheduled run. The default is false.
```

In the following example, two schedules are defined.

```yaml
schedules:
- cron: "0 0 * * *"
  displayName: Daily midnight build
  branches:
    include:
    - master
    - releases/*
    exclude:
    - releases/ancient/*
- cron: "0 12 * * 0"
  displayName: Weekly Sunday build
  branches:
    include:
    - releases/*
  always: true
```

The first schedule, **Daily midnight build**, runs a pipeline at midnight every day, but only if the code has changed since the last successful scheduled run, for `master` and all `releases/*` branches, except those under `releases/ancient/*`.

The second schedule, **Weekly Sunday build**, runs a pipeline at noon on Sundays, whether the code has changed or not since the last run, for all `releases/*` branches.

> [!NOTE]
> The time zone for cron schedules is UTC, so in these examples, the midnight build and the noon build are at midnight and noon in UTC.

> [!NOTE]
> When you specify a scheduled trigger, only branches that you explicitly configure for inclusion are scheduled. Inclusions are processed first, and then exclusions are removed from that list. If you specify an exclusion but no inclusions, no branches are built.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot use pipeline variables when specifying schedules.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use templates in your YAML file, then the schedules must be specified in the main YAML file and not in the template files.

## Scheduled runs view

You can view a preview of upcoming scheduled builds by choosing **Scheduled runs** from the context menu on the [pipeline details page](../get-started/multi-stage-pipelines-experience.md#view-pipeline-details) for your pipeline. 

![Scheduled runs menu](media/triggers/scheduled-runs-menu.png)

After you create or update your scheduled triggers, you can verify them using this view.

![Scheduled runs](media/triggers/scheduled-runs.png)

In this example, the scheduled runs for the following schedule are displayed.

```yaml
schedules:
- cron: "0 0 * * *"
  displayName: Daily midnight build
  branches:
    include:
    - master
```

The **Scheduled runs** windows displays the times converted to the local time zone set on the computer used to browse to the Azure DevOps portal. In this example the screenshot was taken in the EST time zone.

## Scheduled triggers evaluation

Scheduled triggers are evaluated for a branch when the following events occur.

* A pipeline is created.
* A pipeline's YAML file is updated, either from a push, or by editing it in the pipeline editor.
* A new branch is created. 

After one of these events occurs in a branch, any scheduled runs for that branch are added, if that branch matches the branch filters for the scheduled triggers contained in the YAML file in that branch.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Scheduled runs for a branch are added only if the branch matches the branch filters for the 
> scheduled triggers in the YAML file **in that particular branch**.

### Example of scheduled triggers for multiple branches

For example, a pipeline is created with the following schedule, and this version of the YAML file is checked into the `master` branch. This schedule builds the `master` branch on a daily basis.

```yaml
# YAML file in the master branch
schedules:
- cron: "0 0 * * *"
  displayName: Daily midnight build
  branches:
    include:
    - master
```

Next, a new branch is created based off of `master`, named `new-feature`. The scheduled triggers from the YAML file in the new branch are read, and since there is no match for the `new-feature` branch, no changes are made to the scheduled builds, and the `new-feature` branch is not built using a scheduled trigger.

If `new-feature` is added to the `branches` list and this change is pushed to the `new-feature` branch, the YAML file is read, and since `new-feature` is now in the branches list, a scheduled build is added for the `new-feature` branch.

```yaml
# YAML file in the new-feature-branch
schedules:
- cron: "0 0 * * *"
  displayName: Daily midnight build
  branches:
    include:
    - master
    - new-feature
```

Now consider that a branch named `release` is created based off `master`, and then `release` is added to the branch filters in the YAML file in the `master` branch, but not in the newly created `release` branch.

```yaml
# YAML file in the release branch
schedules:
- cron: "0 0 * * *"
  displayName: Daily midnight build
  branches:
    include:
    - master

# YAML file in the master branch with release added to the branches list
schedules:
- cron: "0 0 * * *"
  displayName: Daily midnight build
  branches:
    include:
    - master
    - release
```

Because `release` was added to the branch filters in the `master` branch, but **not** to the branch filters in the `release` branch, the `release` branch won't be built on that schedule. Only when the `feature` branch is added to the branch filters in the YAML file **in the feature branch** will the scheduled build be added to the scheduler.

## Supported cron syntax

Each cron expression is a space-delimited expression with five entries in the following order.

```
mm HH DD MM DW
 \  \  \  \  \__ Days of week
  \  \  \  \____ Months
   \  \  \______ Days
    \  \________ Hours
     \__________ Minutes
```

Field        | Accepted values
-------------|----------------
Minutes      | 0 through 59
Hours        | 0 though 23
Days         | 1 through 31
Months       | 1 through 12, full English names, first three letters of English names
Days of week | 0 through 6 (starting with Sunday), full English names, first three letters of English names

Values can be in the following formats.

Format          | Example          | Description
----------------|------------------|------------
Wildcard        | `*`              | Matches all values for this field
Single value    | `5`              | Specifies a single value for this field
Comma delimited | `3,5,6`          | Specifies multiple values for this field. Multiple formats can be combined, like `1,3-6`
Ranges          | `1-3`            | The inclusive range of values for this field
Intervals       | `*/4` or `1-5/2` | Intervals to match for this field, such as every 4th value or the range 1-5 with a step interval of 2

Example | Cron expression
--------|----------------
Build every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 6:00 PM | `0 18 * * Mon,Wed,Fri`, `0 18 * * 1,3,5`, `0 18 * * Mon,Wed,Fri`, or `0 18 * * 1-5/2`
Build every 6 hours | `0 0,6,12,18 * * *`, `0 */6 * * *` or `0 0-18/6 * * *`
Build every 6 hours starting at 9:00 AM | `0 9,15,21 * * *` or `0 9-21/6 * * *`

For more information on supported formats, see [Crontab Expression](https://github.com/atifaziz/NCrontab/wiki/Crontab-Expression).

<a name="always"></a>
## Running even when there are no code changes

By default, your pipeline does not run as scheduled if there have been no code changes since the last successful scheduled run. For instance, consider that you have scheduled a pipeline to run every night at 9:00pm. During the weekdays, you push various changes to your code. The pipeline runs as per schedule. During the weekends, you do not make any changes to your code. If there have been no code changes since the scheduled run on Friday, then the pipeline does not run as scheduled during the weekend. To force a pipeline to run even when there are no code changes, you can use the `always` keyword.

```yaml
schedules:
- cron: ...
  ...
  always: true
```

<a name="limits"></a>
## Limits on the number of scheduled runs

There are certain limits on how often you can schedule a pipeline to run. These limits have been put in place to prevent misuse of Azure Pipelines resources - particularly the Microsoft-hosted agents. This limit is around 1000 runs per pipeline per week.

## Migrating from the classic editor

The following examples show you how to migrate your schedules from the classic editor to YAML.

* [Example: Nightly build of Git repo in multiple time zones](#example-nightly-build-of-git-repo-in-multiple-time-zones)
* [Example: Nightly build with different frequencies](#example-nightly-build-with-different-frequencies)

### Example: Nightly build of Git repo in multiple time zones

In this example, the classic editor scheduled trigger has two entries, producing the following builds.

* Every Monday - Friday at 3:00 AM (UTC + 5:30 time zone), build branches that meet the `features/india/*` branch filter criteria

    ![Scheduled trigger UTC + 5:30 time zone](media/triggers/scheduled-trigger-git-india.png)

* Every Monday - Friday at 3:00 AM (UTC - 5:00 time zone), build branches that meet the `features/nc/*` branch filter criteria

    ![Scheduled trigger UTC -5:00 time zone](media/triggers/scheduled-trigger-git-nc.png)

The equivalent YAML scheduled trigger is:

```yaml
schedules:
- cron: "30 21 * * Sun-Thu"
  displayName: M-F 3:00 AM (UTC + 5:30) India daily build
  branches:
    include:
    - /features/india/*
- cron: "0 8 * * Mon-Fri"
  displayName: M-F 3:00 AM (UTC - 5) NC daily build
  branches:
    include:
    - /features/nc/*
```

In the first schedule, **M-F 3:00 AM (UTC + 5:30) India daily build**, the cron syntax (`mm HH DD MM DW`) is `30 21 * * Sun-Thu`.

* Minutes and Hours - `30 21` - This maps to `21:30 UTC` (`9:30 PM UTC`). Since the specified time zone in the classic editor is **UTC + 5:30**, we need to subtract 5 hours and 30 minutes from the desired build time of 3:00 AM to arrive at the desired UTC time to specify for the YAML trigger.
* Days and Months are specified as wildcards since this schedule doesn't specify to run only on certain days of the month or on a specific month. 
* Days of the week - `Sun-Thu` - because of the timezone conversion, for our builds to run at 3:00 AM in the UTC + 5:30 India time zone, we need to specify starting them the previous day in UTC time. We could also specify the days of the week as `0-4` or `0,1,2,3,4`.

In the second schedule, **M-F 3:00 AM (UTC - 5) NC daily build**, the cron syntax is `0 8 * * Mon-Fri`.

* Minutes and Hours - `0 8` - This maps to `8:00 AM UTC`. Since the specified time zone in the classic editor is **UTC - 5:00**, we need to add 5 hours from the desired build time of 3:00 AM to arrive at the desired UTC time to specify for the YAML trigger.
* Days and Months are specified as wildcards since this schedule doesn't specify to run only on certain days of the month or on a specific month. 
* Days of the week - `Mon-Fri` - Because our timezone conversions don't span multiple days of the week for our desired schedule, we don't need to do any conversion here. We could also specify the days of the week as `1-5` or `1,2,3,4,5`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The UTC time zones in YAML scheduled triggers don't account for daylight savings time.

### Example: Nightly build with different frequencies

In this example, the classic editor scheduled trigger has two entries, producing the following builds.

* Every Monday - Friday at 3:00 AM UTC, build branches that meet the `master` and `releases/*` branch filter criteria

    ![scheduled trigger different frequencies](media/triggers/scheduled-trigger-git-week-day-night.png)

* Every Sunday at 3:00 AM UTC, build the `releases/lastversion` branch, even if the source or pipeline hasn't changed

    ![scheduled trigger different frequencies](media/triggers/scheduled-trigger-git-weekly-night.png)

The equivalent YAML scheduled trigger is:

```yaml
schedules:
- cron: "0 3 * * Mon-Fri"
  displayName: M-F 3:00 AM (UTC) daily build
  branches:
    include:
    - master
    - /releases/*
- cron: "0 3 * * Sun"
  displayName: Sunday 3:00 AM (UTC) weekly latest version build
  branches:
    include:
    - /releases/lastversion
  always: true
```

In the first schedule, **M-F 3:00 AM (UTC) daily build**, the cron syntax is `0 3 * * Mon-Fri`.

* Minutes and Hours - `0 3` - This maps to `3:00 AM UTC`. Since the specified time zone in the classic editor is **UTC**, we don't need to do any time zone conversions.
* Days and Months are specified as wildcards since this schedule doesn't specify to run only on certain days of the month or on a specific month. 
* Days of the week - `Mon-Fri` - because there is no timezone conversion, the days of the week map directly from the classic editor schedule. We could also specify the days of the week as `1,2,3,4,5`.

In the second schedule, **Sunday 3:00 AM (UTC) weekly latest version build**, the cron syntax is `0 3 * * Sun`.

* Minutes and Hours - `0 3` - This maps to `3:00 AM UTC`. Since the specified time zone in the classic editor is **UTC**, we don't need to do any time zone conversions.
* Days and Months are specified as wildcards since this schedule doesn't specify to run only on certain days of the month or on a specific month. 
* Days of the week - `Sun` - Because our timezone conversions don't span multiple days of the week for our desired schedule, we don't need to do any conversion here. We could also specify the days of the week as `0`.
* We also specify `always: true` since this build is scheduled to run whether or not the source code has been updated.

## Q & A

### I defined a schedule in the YAML file. But it didn't run. What happened?

* Check the next few runs that Azure Pipelines has scheduled for your pipeline. You can find these by selecting the **Scheduled runs** action in your pipeline. You need to have the **Multi-stage pipelines** preview feature enabled to see this action. The list is filtered down to only show you the upcoming few runs over the next few days. If this does not meet your expectation, it is probably the case that you have mistyped your cron schedule, or you do not have the schedule defined in the correct branch. Read the topic above to understand how to configure schedules. Reevaluate your cron syntax. All the times for cron schedules are in UTC.

* If you have any schedules defined in the UI, then your YAML schedules are not honored. Ensure that you do not have any UI schedules by navigating to the editor for your pipeline and then selecting **Triggers**.

* There is a limit on the number of runs you can schedule for a pipeline. Read more about [limits](#limits).

* If there are no changes to your code, they Azure Pipelines may not start new runs. Learn how to [override](#always) this behavior.

### Schedules defined in YAML pipeline work for one branch but not the other. How do I fix this?

Schedules are defined in YAML files, and these files are associated with branches. If you want a pipeline to be scheduled for a particular branch, say features/X, then make sure that the YAML file in that branch has the cron schedule defined in it, and that it has the correct branch inclusions for the schedule. The YAML file in features/X branch should have the following in this example: 
 
```yaml
schedules: 
- cron: "0 12 * * 0"   # replace with your schedule 
  branches: 
    include: 
    - features/X  
```

### My YAML schedules were working fine. But, they stopped working now. How do I debug this?

* If you did not specify `always:true`, your pipeline won't be scheduled unless there are any updates made to your code. Check whether there have been any code changes and how you [configured the schedules](#always).

* There is a [limit](#limits) on how many times you can schedule your pipeline. Check if you have exceeded those limits.

* Check if someone enabled additional schedules in the UI. Open the editor for your pipeline, and select **Triggers**. If they defined schedules in the UI, then your YAML schedules won't be honored.

* Check if your pipeline is paused or disabled. Select **Settings** for your pipeline.
