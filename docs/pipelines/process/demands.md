Use demands to make sure that the capabilities your pipeline needs are present on the agents that run it. Demands are asserted automatically by tasks or manually by you.

> [!NOTE]
> Demands are only applicable when your pipeline runs on self-hosted agents.

## Task demands

Some tasks won't run unless one or more demands are met by the agent. For example, the [Visual Studio Build](../tasks/build/visual-studio-build.md) task demands that ```msbuild``` and ```visualstudio``` are installed on the agent.

## Manually entered demands

You might need to use self-hosted agents with special capabilities. For example, your pipeline requires **SpecialSoftware** on agents in the `Default` pool.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

```yaml
pool:
  name: Default
  demands: SpecialSoftware
```

For multiple demands:

```yaml
pool:
  name: MyPool
  demands:
  - myCustomCapability   # check for existence of capability
  - agent.os -equals Darwin  # check for specific string in capability
```

For more information and examples, see [YAML schema - Demands](../yaml-schema.md#demands).

# [Classic](#tab/classic)

In the options tab of the pipeline, add the demand to your pipeline.

| Name | Type |
|---|---|
| SpecialSoftware | exists |

---

Register each agent that has the capability.

1. In your web browser, navigate to Agent pools:

   [!INCLUDE [agent-pools-tab](../agents/_shared/agent-pools-tab.md)]

1. Navigate to the capabilities tab for the agent:
 
   [!INCLUDE [agent-capabilities](../agents/_shared/agent-capabilities-tab.md)]

1. Add something like the following entry:

| First box | Second box |
|---|---|
| SpecialSoftware | C:\Program Files (x86)\SpecialSoftware |

> [!TIP]
> When you manually queue a build you can change the demands for that run.
