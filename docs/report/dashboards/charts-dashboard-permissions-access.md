# Default dashboard permissions and access   

**VSTS | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015.1-2015.3**


You can define and manage dashboards from the web portal, **Dashboard** hub. For an overview of dashboard and chart features, see [Dashboards](overview.md). 

You can access most features when you are added as a team member or a member of the Contributors group for a team project. The most common built-in groups include Readers, Contributors, and Project Administrators. For a simplified view of all default permissions assigned to built-in groups, see [Default permissions and access](../../security/permissions-access.md).  

Stakeholders have limited access to view charts and dashboards. To learn more, see [About access levels](../../security/access-levels.md).


You set [dashboard permissions at the team level](dashboard-permissions.md) from the team dashboard page.

>**Feature availability:**  For VSTS and TFS 2017.1 and later versions, you can [set dashboard permissions](dashboard-permissions.md).
