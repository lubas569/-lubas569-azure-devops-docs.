Dashboards are viewable by all members of the Project Valid Users group. Permissions to edit or delete dashboards or manage permissions can be set for both team or project dashboards. 
 
As a member of the Project Administrators group, you can set the default dashboard permissions for all teams. As a team or project administrator, you can set individual dashboard permissions for team members. The permissions only impact the team members and their team dashboards.

To learn more about adding and viewing dashboards, see [Add, rename, and delete dashboards](dashboards.md).   

> [!TIP]    
> If a user reports that they can't create or edit a team dashboard, and you've set the permissions to allow them to do so, check that they have been added as a member of the team. This includes adding them as a team member to the default project team. For details, see [Add users to a project or specific team](../../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md).
