# Manual test execution trend sample report

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/version-azure-devops-cloud.md)]

This article shows you how to get the execution state of one or more Test Plans in Power BI. 

[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/preview-note.md)]
 
The report generated is similar to following image and the Outcome trend chart of the [Track test status - Progress report](../../test/track-test-status.md).

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Sample - Execution Trend - Report](media/odatapowerbi-executiontrend.png)

The report displays a trend chart that summarizes the number and outcome states of Test Plans executed over a specified period of time.  

- **Passed**: Number of test cases passing.  
- **Failed**: Number of test cases failing.  
- **NotApplicable**: Number of test cases 
- **Blocked**:  Number of test cases blocked from running.  
- **NotExecuted**: Number of test cases defined but not executed.  

## Questions the report answers

This report helps you track the team's progress with respect to planned testing of your product or service by answering the following questions:

- *How much testing is complete?*
- *What is the current status of tests passing, failing, or being blocked?*
- *How many tests are passing and what does the trend indicate about software quality?*
- *How many tests are failing?*
- *How many tests are blocked and what does the trend indicate?*

A healthy test execution trend report shows a steady progress in test plans running and passing. Ideally, the report shows a relatively flat number of test cases for a given plan. As the development cycle progresses, the number of passing test cases should increase, and the numbers of test cases in other states should decrease.

[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/sample-required-reading.md)]


## Prerequisites

For the report to generate useful data, the team must perform the following activities to manage test plans:

- Define test plans, test suites, and test cases. Specify their state. For a Test Suite to run, it must be in the In Progress state. For a Test Case to run, it must be in the Ready state. For details, see [Create test plans and test suites](../../test/create-a-test-plan.md) and [Create manual test cases](../../test/create-test-cases.md). 
- Run manual tests and verify the results. Mark the results of each validation step in the test case as passed or failed. For details, see [Run manual tests](../../test/run-manual-tests.md).

	> [!NOTE]  
	> Testers must mark a test step with a status if it is a validation test step. The overall result for a test reflects the status of all the test steps that were marked. Therefore, the test will have a status of failed if any test step is marked as failed or not marked.   


## Sample queries

### Substitution strings


Each query contains the following strings that you must substitute with your values. Do not include brackets {} with your substitution. For example if your organization name is "Fabrikam", replace {organization} with **Fabrikam**, not {Fabrikam}. 

- {organization} - Your organization name 
- {project} - Your team project name, or omit "/{project}" entirely, for a cross-project query
- {testPlanTitle} - Title of your test plan. Example: Fabrikam test plan.
- {startDate} and {endDate} - Date range of interest. You can enter the dates in YYYYMMDD format. e.g. 20190822 for 22nd August 2019.


### Query breakdown

The following table describes each part of the query.


<table width="90%">
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td width="25%"><b>Query part</b></td><td><b>Description</b></td><tr>
<tr><td><code>filter((TestSuite/TestPlanTitle eq '{testPlanTitle}'))</code></td><td>Return data for only selected test plan. You can add multiple plans with a clause like <code>filter((TestSuite/TestPlanTitle eq '{testPlanTitle1}' or TestSuite/TestPlanTitle eq '{testPlanTitle2}'))</code>. You can also apply any other filters related to test suites, test configurations here.</td><tr>
<tr><td><code>and (DateSK ge {startDate} and DateSK le {endDate})</code></td><td>Date range of interest. You can enter the dates in YYYYMMDD format.</td><tr>
<tr><td><code>/groupby((DateSK)</code></td><td>Group the data into bins of same date. This produces one set of values per day in given date range.</td><tr>
<tr><td><code>/aggregate($count as TotalCount,</code></td><td>Aggregate data across the filtered test points with having count as <code>TotalCount</code></td><tr>
<tr><td><code>cast(LastResultOutcome eq 'Passed', Edm.Int32) with sum as Passed,</code></td><td>While aggregating, type-cast test points having latest execution outcome 'Passed' to 1 and sum them up as '<code>Passed</code>' metric.</td><tr>

## Power BI transforms

[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/sample-test-plans-finish-query.md)]


## Create the report

Power BI shows you the fields you can report on. 

> [!NOTE]   
> The example below assumes that no one renamed any columns. 


> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Sample - Execution Trend - Fields](media/odatapowerbi-executiontrend-fields.png)

To create the report, do the following steps:

1. Create a Power BI visualization **Stacked Area Chart**.
1. Drag and drop **DateSK** in **Axis**.
1. Drag and drop **Passed, Failed, Blocked, NotApplicable** and **NotExecuted** in **Values**.

Your report should look similar to the following image.

> ![Sample - Execution Trend - Report](media/odatapowerbi-executiontrend.png)
