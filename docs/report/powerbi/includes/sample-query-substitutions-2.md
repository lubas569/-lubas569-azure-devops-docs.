Each query contains the following strings that you must substitute with your values. Don't include brackets {} with your substitution. For example if your organization name is "Fabrikam", replace {organization} with **Fabrikam**, not {Fabrikam}. 

- {organization} - Your organization name 
- {project} - Your team project name, or omit "/{project}" entirely, for a cross-project query
- {iterationSK} - Iteration SK of the iteration path you are interested in
- {areaSK} - Area SK of the area path you are interested in.
