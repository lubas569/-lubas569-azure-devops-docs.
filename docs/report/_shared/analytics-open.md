## Open Analytics to access views

After you install the [Analytics Marketplace extension](../analytics/analytics-extension.md), a set of default Analytics views are created for each team project. You can view, modify, and create a custom view from **Analytics**. 

From a web browser, expand **Overview** and choose **Analytics views**. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Open Analytics view, new navigation](/azure/devops/report/analytics/_img/open-analytics/open-analytics-views-vert.png)   

If you don't see the team or team project you want, choose the ![ ](/azure/devops/boards/_img/icons/project-icon.png) Azure DevOps logo to [browse all projects](/azure/devops/project/navigation/work-across-projects).
