### Q: How do I view all work items? 

**A:** To view all work items defined in a project, open a query and add two clauses: 
- `Work Item Type = [Any]`
- `State = [Any]` 

From there, you can add filters to refine the query. To learn more, see [Create and save managed queries with the query editor](/azure/devops/boards/queries/using-queries).
