# Query fields, operators, and macros

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)] 

Here you'll find detailed descriptions of each field data type, query operators, and query macros. Some data types, operators, and macros are only valid for the indicated Azure DevOps Server or Team Foundation Server (TFS) version. 

For a quick reference of query tasks and operators and macros supported for each data type, see [Query quick reference](query-index-quick-ref.md).

<a id="field-values" /> 
## Query field data types and values

The value you specify for a field must conform to the data type for that field. The following table lists the supported data types:

> [!NOTE]  
> For Azure Boards cloud service, the data type corresponds to that listed for the field on the [Process>Fields page](../../organizations/settings/work/customize-process-field.md#review-fields). For on-premises deployments, the data type corresponds to the `type` attribute assigned to a [`FIELD` definition](../../reference/xml/field-definition-element-reference.md). For more information, see [Work item fields and field attributes](../work-items/work-item-fields.md).

####Notes:
1. The **Boolean** data type field is supported for TFS 2017 and later versions. 
2. The **picklist...** data types are only assigned to custom fields defined for an inherited process. The Inherited process model is only supported for Azure DevOps Services and Azure DevOps Server 2019.

## Query macros or variables

You can use the macros described in the following table to filter your queries based on specific fields. 

> [!NOTE]
> The following macros are only supported from the web portal: **@CurrentIteration**, **@Follows**, **@MyRecentActivity**, **@RecentMentions**, **@RecentProjectActivity**, **@TeamAreas**. Queries that contain these macros won't work when opened in Visual Studio/Team Explorer, Microsoft Excel, or Microsoft Project.

For specific examples, see [Query by date or current iteration](query-by-date-or-current-iteration.md).
	<p>This macro only works when run from the web portal. You can't use the macro when [copying or cloning test suites and test cases](../../test/mtm/copying-and-cloning-test-suites-and-test-cases.md), [defining alerts](../../notifications/index.md), or with [REST APIs](../../integrate/get-started/rest/basics.md).</p>

	<td>Use in conjunction with the **ID** field and **In** operator to list all work items that you are following in the project. To learn more about the Follow feature, see [Follow a work item or pull request](../work-items/follow-work-items.md). You can view this same list from the [Work Items page, **Following** pivot view](../work-items/view-add-work-items.md).

<tr>
	<td>**@Me**</td>
	<td>Use in conjunction with an identity or user account field to automatically search for items associated with your user or account name.

####Notes:
0. The **@CurrentIteration** macro is supported for Azure Boards and TFS 2015 and later versions. 
0. The **@CurrentIteration +/- n** macro is supported for Azure Boards, Azure DevOps Server 2019 and later versions,  and only when run from the web portal. 
0. The **@Follows** macro is supported for Azure Boards and TFS 2017 and later versions.
0. The **@MyRecentActivity**, **@RecentMentions**, **@RecentProjectActivity** macros are supported for Azure Boards and TFS 2018.2 and later versions.
0. The **@Project** macro is supported for Azure Boards and TFS 2015.1 and later versions. The system automatically defaults to filtering based on the current project. To learn more, see [Query across projects](using-queries.md#across-projects). 
0. The **@RecentProjectActivity** macro is supported for Azure Boards (cloud service) only at this time.
0. The **@TeamAreas** macro is supported for Azure Boards and Azure DevOps Server 2019 and later versions.

 

<a id="full-text" /> 
## Full-text and partial word searches

Specify **Contains** or **Does Not Contain** to search against exact or partial matches of a word or phrase. Specify **Contains Words** or **Does Not Contain Words** to search against an exact phrase or to use the wildcard character, **&#42;**. These operators use the full-text search index. You can only use the wildcard character at the end of a partial word or phrase.

For examples, see [Example work item queries](example-queries.md) and [Query for work items using the History field](history-and-auditing.md).

<!---
> [!NOTE]    
> Not all deployments support full-text searches. For example, SQL Express and SQL Azure, which support the cloud service, do not support full-text search. In these instances, you will only see the **Contains** and **Does not Contain** operators.
-->

**Contains Words** and **Does Not Contain Words** filter items based on the full-text search index created for long-text fields. 

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2013 <= azure-devops-2019"
Azure DevOps Server and Team Foundation Server automatically indexes all long-text fields with a data type of **PlainText** and **HTML** and the **Title** field for full-text search. The index and operators are only available when the SQL Server that supports Team Foundation Server supports full-text search.

Full-text searches require a SQL collation that corresponds to a language which has a word breaker registered with SQL Server. If the collation settings for the project collection database used for your Team Foundation Server instance do not correspond to a supported language, your search results may not match your expectations. In these cases, you might try using the **Contains** or **Does Not Contain** operators.

For more information, see [Full-Text Search Queries and Collation Settings](/tfs/server/install/sql-server/collation-requirements).

## Query indexed fields

In addition to the full-text search index, a query index is created. It is based on those fields that have indexing enabled. The query index improves the response time when you run queries that include indexed fields.

By default, the following fields are indexed: **Assigned To**, **Created Date**, **Changed By**, **State**, **Reason**, **Area ID**, **Iteration ID**, and **Work Item Type**. If there are other fields that your team frequently uses in their queries, you can add them to the query index.

You use the **witadmin indexfield** command to enable or disable indexing for a field. See [Manage work item fields](../../reference/witadmin/manage-work-item-fields.md?toc=/azure/devops/reference/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/reference/breadcrumb/toc.json).
