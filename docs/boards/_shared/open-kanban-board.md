## Open your Kanban board from the web portal

Your Kanban board is one of two types of boards available to you. For an overview of the features supported on each backlog and board, see [Backlogs, boards, and plans](/azure/devops/boards/backlogs/backlogs-boards-plans). To switch to the [product backlog](/azure/devops/boards/backlogs/create-your-backlog), choose **Stories backlog**. And, to switch to the [Task board](/azure/devops/boards/sprints/task-board), choose **Sprints** and then choose **Taskboard**.  

> [!NOTE]
> Choose **Previous navigation** when you see a top-level blue bar. Choose **New navigation** if you see a vertical sidebar or if you enabled the **New Navigation** preview feature. The vertical sidebar, along with other navigational features, is enabled when the **New Navigation** preview feature has been enabled for the signed-in user or the organization. To learn how to use the web portal effectively, see [Web portal navigation](/azure/devops/project/navigation/index).    
> 
> For on-premises TFS, choose **Previous Navigation** for guidance.
