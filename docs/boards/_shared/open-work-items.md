## Open the Work Items page
You can start viewing and adding work items once you connect to a project. 

<a id="browser" /> 

> [!NOTE]
> The **New navigation** feature, which provides a vertical navigation experience, is in preview for Azure DevOps Services. [Go here to enable it](../../project/navigation/preview-features.md). When you enable **New navigation**, you automatically enable several new Agile tool features described in this blog post, [New Work Hubs](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2018/06/22/new-work-hubs/). For on-premises TFS users, choose **Previous navigation** for guidance. 

# [New navigation](#tab/new-nav)
::: moniker range="vsts"
(1) Check that you have selected the right project, then (2) choose **Boards>Work Items**.

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2013 <= tfs-2018"
The **New Navigation** feature isn't supported on the TFS platform at this time. Choose the **Previous Navigation** for guidance.
::: moniker-end

# [Previous navigation](#tab/previous-nav)

Open a browser window, choose **Work**, and then **Work Items**.

> Depending on the process chosen when the project was created&mdash;[Agile](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/agile-process-workflow), [Scrum](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/scrum-process-workflow), or [CMMI](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/cmmi-process-workflow)&mdash;the types of work items you can create will differ. For example, backlog items may be called user stories (Agile), product backlog items (Scrum), or requirements (CMMI). All three are similar: they describe the customer value to deliver and the work to be performed.
