> ![Excel TFS-Office integration Team ribbon](media/tfs-office-issues-excel-team-ribbon.png)

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../includes/deprecate-project.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> All Office integration tasks require that you have installed a version of Visual Studio or the free [Azure DevOps Office Integration 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads). These software installs the Azure DevOps Office Integration Add-in or Team Foundation Office Integration Add-in  For a list of prerequisites, see [Azure Boards and Office integration](track-work.md). 

## Enable the Azure DevOps or Team Foundation Add-in 

1.	From the Excel **File** menu, choose **Options**.  
2.	Choose Add-ins and from the **Manage** picklist, choose **COM Add-ins**, and then choose **Go**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Excel Options, Add-ins, Choose Com Add-ins](media/tfs-office-issues-excel-open-com-add-ins.png)

3.	Make sure that a check is placed in the **Team Foundation Add-in** checkbox. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![COM Add-ins dialog, Team Foundation Add-in checked](media/tfs-office-issues-excel-tfs-add-in-checkbox.png) 

4.	Restart Excel. You should now see the Team ribbon. 

If the Team ribbon does not appear at next launch, the load behavior of the add-in may have changed and you will need to complete the following steps: 

### Update the Registry 

1.	Launch the Registry Editor from your Windows Start Menu by typing regedit in the Search or Run box.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Run regedit command](media/tfs-office-issues-run-regedit.png) 

2.	Navigate to one of the following paths containing the **TFCOfficeShim.Connect.[version]** folder:
	
	> [!NOTE]  
	>If there are multiple folders with the same name, select the one with the highest version number. 

	- HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\Excel\Addins (if this key does not exist, try one of the options below)
	- HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\Excel\Addins
	- HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Office\Excel\Addins

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![LoadBehavior entry](media/tfs-office-issues-regedit-loadbehavior-key.png) 

3.	Double click to open **LoadBehavior** and set the value data field to **3** (if the value is **0**, the Team ribbon will not load).
 
4.	Press **OK** and restart Excel. 

	To learn more about the LoadBehavior entry, see [Registry Entries for VSTO Add-ins, LoadBehavior values](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb386106.aspx#LoadBehavior).  

## Office Add-in doesn't load or "Open in Excel" from Visual Studio fails

To connect to Azure Boards or TFS, go to the Team ribbon and choose **New List**. If the New List dialog fails to open, or you receive TF86001 or similar error message, follow the steps below to ensure that policy redirection is configured. 
 
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![TF86001 error message, Team Foundation was unable to load the Office Add-in](media/tfs-office-issues-tf86001.png) 

This error is typically caused when you install Visual Studio before you install Office Excel or Project. In this instance, the Visual Studio Tools for Office Run Time are not correctly configured. To correct this error, you must repair Visual Studio.

> [!NOTE]
> For authentication issues, such as `TF31003` and `TF30063`, please refer to [User account does not have permission](/azure/devops/reference/error/tf31003-user-account-no-permission-connect-tfs).

### Prerequisites 

Install Visual Studio to ensure that you have access to the Visual Studio Command Prompt and the  [Gacutil.exe (Global Assembly Cache Tool)](/dotnet/framework/tools/gacutil-exe-gac-tool). If you do not have Visual Studio, you can install the [Visual Studio Community edition for free](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).   

### Run the Gacutil tool  

1. Open the Visual Studio Command Prompt and choose to run it as an administrator. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Developer Command Prompt for VS2015 start menu with 'Run as administrator](media/tfs-office-issues-run-developer-cmd-prompt.png) 

2. **For Office 2016 and Office 2013**, run the following commands:   

   ```
   GACUTIL /I C:\Windows\assembly\GAC_MSIL\Policy.12.0.Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel\15.0.0.0__71e9bce111e9429c\Policy.12.0.Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.dll
   ```  

   ```
   GACUTIL /I C:\Windows\assembly\GAC_MSIL\Policy.12.0.office\15.0.0.0__71e9bce111e9429c\Policy.12.0.Office.dll
   ```

   **For Office 2010**, run the following commands:  

   ```
   GACUTIL /I C:\Windows\assembly\GAC_MSIL\Policy.12.0.Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel\14.0.0.0__71e9bce111e9429c\Policy.12.0.Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.dll
   ```  

   ```
   GACUTIL /I C:\Windows\assembly\GAC_MSIL\Policy.12.0.office\14.0.0.0__71e9bce111e9429c\Policy.12.0.Office.dll
   ```  

3. Once you've successfully run the `GACUTIL` commands, restart Excel and look for the Team Foundation Add-in. 

If the above steps are unsuccessful, try the following steps:  

1.	Perform a full [repair of Office](https://support.office.com/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US).  

2.	Uninstall Office and Reinstall Office. 

3.	Contact the Microsoft support team.
