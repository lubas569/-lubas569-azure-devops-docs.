# Backlogs, work items, and Agile project management 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

You plan and track your project using the suite of Agile tools you access from the web portal. Agile tools support the core Agile methods&mdash;Scrum and Kanban&mdash;used by software development teams today. Scrum tools support defining and managing work within sprints, setting capacity, and tracking tasks. Kanban tools allow you to manage a continuous flow of work via an interactive sign board.  

If you're new to Agile, see [What is Agile?](/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile) for an overview.


## Product and portfolio backlogs 

Backlogs present work items as lists. A product backlog represents your project plan, the roadmap for what your team plans to deliver. Your backlog also provides a repository of all the information you need to track and share with your team. Portfolio backlogs allow you to group and organize your backlog into a hierarchy. To get started, see [Create your backlog](../backlogs/create-your-backlog.md).

## Define work items and create your backlog  

You build your project plan by creating a backlog of work items that represent the features, requirements, user stories, or other work to perform. Portfolio backlogs provide support for organizing work in a hierarchical fashion and tracking major product initiatives or scenarios that rely on many stories or requirements.  Different types of work items help you track different types of work, such as user stories, tasks, bugs, issues, and more.

## Customize your backlogs 
If you need more than three backlog levels, you can add more. To learn how, see [Customize your backlogs or boards for a process](../../organizations/settings/work/customize-process-backlogs-boards.md).

## Try this next  

Take these tools for a test run by [signing up for Azure Boards](../get-started/index.md). 

Once you've started tracking work, you'll want to monitor and track progress, identify trends, and share your plans. See [Charts, dashboards, and widgets](../../report/overview.md).

You access tools provided by Azure Boards and TFS by connecting from a client to the server, either in the cloud or on-premises. Some web portal tools require additional Visual Studio Subscriptions or Advanced/VS Enterprise access.
