# Create your backlog

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

Your product backlog corresponds to your project plan, the roadmap for what your team plans to deliver. 
Once defined, you have a prioritized list of features and requirements to build. Your backlog also provides a 
repository of all the information you need to track and share with your team.

Your backlog consists of a list of [work items](add-work-items.md). 
You use work items to share information, assign work to team members, track dependencies, organize work, 
and more. Because the most important work appears at the top of the list, your team always knows what to work on next.

> [!NOTE]  
> Your product backlog is one of three classes of backlogs available to you. For an overview of the features supported on each backlog and the two types of boards, see [Backlogs, boards, and plans](backlogs-boards-plans.md).   


[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/prerequisites.md)]

## Open your backlog from the web portal

From your web browser, open your product backlog.  

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/new-navigation.md)]

	To choose another team, open the selector and select a different team or choose the ![home-icon](../../_img/icons/home-icon.png) **Browse all sprints** option. Or, you can enter a keyword in the search box to filter the list of team backlogs for the project.

## Determine if bugs should appear on your backlog 

You have a choice as to how you want to manage bugs. Some teams like to track bugs along with requirements on the backlog. Other teams like to track bugs as tasks performed in support of a requirement, and have them appear on their [task board](../sprints/task-board.md).

If you're using the Scrum process, your default setup is to track bugs along with PBIs. However, if you're working in a project based on the [Agile or CMMI processes](../work-items/guidance/choose-process.md), bugs don't automatically appear on your backlog.

Talk with your team to determine how they want to manage bugs and then [change your team settings](../../organizations/settings/show-bugs-on-backlog.md) accordingly.

> [!NOTE]    
> Because this setting affects all team members' view of the team backlogs and boards, you must be a team administrator to change the setting. Changing the setting is disabled if you're not a team administrator. Go [here to get added as a team administrator](../../organizations/settings/add-team-administrator.md).

> [!TIP]  
> If, after refreshing a backlog or board, you don't see bugs where you expect them, review [How backlogs and boards display hierarchical (nested) items](resolve-backlog-reorder-issues.md). Only leaf nodes of nested items will appear on the Kanban or task boards.  


## Convert ideas into backlog items or stories

Your backlog shows work that you are planning to do or have started working on. As soon as the State of a work item is set to Done or Completed, the work item no longer shows up on your backlog. You can use the [backlog controls](product-backlog-controls.md) to filter or change your view. 

> [!TIP]  
> If you've already defined a long list of items, you don't have to reenter them one at a time. Instead, use [Microsoft Excel](../backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md) to quickly import them to your backlog.

# [New navigation](#tab/new-nav)

> [!NOTE]  
> Depending on the process chosen to create your project&mdash;[Agile](../work-items/guidance/agile-process.md), [Scrum](../work-items/guidance/scrum-process.md), or [CMMI](../work-items/guidance/cmmi-process.md)&mdash;
the items in your backlog may be called user stories, product backlog items (PBIs), or requirements. All three are similar: they describe the customer value to be delivered and the work to be performed.   
>
>By default,  user stories on Agile backlogs, PBIs and bugs appear on Scrum backlogs, and requirements on CMMI backlogs. 

<a id="move-items-priority-order">  </a>
## Move items into priority order
After you've got some items on your backlog, you can reorder them to create a prioritized list of work. Frequently reviewing and prioritizing your backlog can help your team know what's most important to deliver next.

Reorder your backlog by simply dragging work items. Or, if you prefer the keyboard, hold the Alt key and use the up and down arrows.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Reorder work items](_img/create-backlog/cyb-order-backlog.png)


> [!TIP]  
> You can't sort your backlog on a column. If you want to view a sorted listed, click **Create query**, save and open the query, and then sort the query results. To learn more about queries, see [Use the query editor to list and manage queries](../queries/using-queries.md).


<a id="estimates">  </a>
## Add details and estimates
Getting your backlog built and prioritized provides the high level roadmap. 
However, before your team can actually start work on any item, they'll need 
more details. You capture these details within the work item form.

> [!TIP]  
> To plan a sprint, at a minimum you should estimate the effort involved to implement each backlog item. You capture effort in the following fields within the work item form: Effort (Scrum), Story Points (Agile), or Size (CMMI) fields. 

Open each item (double-click, or press Enter to open the selected item) and add all the info you want to track. Enter as much detail as the team needs to understand the scope, estimate the work required, develop tests, and ensure that the end product meets acceptance criteria.  

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Product Backlog Item form](_img/create-backlog/pbi-form.png) 

<table valign="top" width="100%">
<tbody valign="top" >
<tr>
<th width="20%">Field</th>
<th width="80%">Usage</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>[Effort](../queries/query-numeric.md)<br/>
[Story Points](../queries/query-numeric.md)<br/>
[Size](../queries/query-numeric.md)</td> 
<td>
<a name="estimates"></a>
<p>Provide a relative estimate of the amount of work required to complete a PBI. For user stories and requirements, you capture estimates in the Story Points and Size fields.</p> 
<p>Most Agile methods recommend setting estimates for backlog items based on relative size of work. Such methods include powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8) and the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.). Use any numeric unit of measurement your team prefers. </p>
<p>The estimates you set for Effort, Size, or Story Points are used in calculating [velocity](../../report/dashboards/velocity-chart-data-store.md) and [forecasting sprints](../sprints/forecast.md).</p>
</td> 
</tr>

<tr>
<td>[Business Value](../queries/query-numeric.md)</td> 
<td>Specify a priority that captures the relative value of a PBI compared to other PBIs. The higher the number, the greater the business value.<br />Use this field when you want to capture a priority separate from the changeable backlog stack ranking.</td> 
</tr>

<tr>
<td>[Description](../queries/titles-ids-descriptions.md)</td> 
<td>Provide enough detail to create shared understanding of scope and to support estimation efforts. Focus on the user, what they want to accomplish, and why. Don't describe how to develop the product. Do provide sufficient details so that your team can write tasks and test cases to implement the item.</td> 
</tr>

<tr>
<td>[Acceptance Criteria](../queries/titles-ids-descriptions.md) </td> 
<td><p>Define what "Done" means by describing the criteria that the team should use to verify whether the PBI or the bug fix has been fully implemented.</p>
<p>Before work begins on a PBI or bug, describe the [criteria for customer acceptance](best-practices-product-backlog.md#acceptance) as clearly as possible. Conversations between the team and customers to determine the acceptance criteria help ensure a common understanding within the team to meet customers' expectations. Also, this info provides the basis for acceptance testing.</p></td> 
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>
 

## Try this next
Now that you've got a working backlog in place, your team can begin work on the top priority items. From here, it's time to make the decision on how you want to work as a team: Scrum or Kanban? You can use these methods independently or together.

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Scrum: Schedule sprints](../sprints/define-sprints.md) or [Kanban](../boards/kanban-quickstart.md) 

Teams that want the least overhead in terms of tracking and estimating may prefer Kanban. Teams that like to work at a steady cadence and plot the details of their sprint plan may prefer Scrum and sprint planning.
