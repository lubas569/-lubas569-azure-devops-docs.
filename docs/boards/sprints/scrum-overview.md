# About Sprints, Scrum and project management 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)] 

The Scrum method uses sprints to plan work to perform by a team within a specific time period and cadence. To get started, several sprints are predefined for your team.  If you're new to Scrum, get an overview from [What is Scrum?](/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-scrum). 


## Sprint backlogs and taskboards

Sprint backlogs and taskboards provide a filtered view of work items a team has assigned to a specific iteration path, or sprint. Sprints are defined for a project and then selected by teams. From your backlog, you can map work to an iteration path using drag-and-drop, and then view that work in a separate **sprint backlog**.

## Implement Scrum 

[![Schedule sprints](../backlogs/_img/overview/gs-planning-define-sprints.png)](define-sprints.md)[![Plan a sprint](../backlogs/_img/overview/gs-planning-plan-sprint.png)](assign-work-sprint.md)[![Monitor sprint progress](../backlogs/_img/overview/gs-planning-monitor-sprint.png)](task-board.md)[![Forecast](../backlogs/_img/overview/gs-planning-forecast.png)](forecast.md)

You can quickly assign work items to a sprint by dragging and dropping them from the product backlog to the sprint.
