# About Kanban and Agile project management 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]
 
Your Kanban board provides you with a visual interactive space for you and your team to plan and show progress. With it, your team can track the critical information they need by seeing which work items are in progress, where the bottlenecks are, who work is assigned to, and more.

Boards present work items as cards and support quick status updates through drag-and-drop, similar to sticky notes on a physical whiteboard. 

## Product and portfolio boards 

Each board supports many Kanban practices such as defining columns and swimlanes, setting Work-in-Progress (WIP) limits, defining the Definition of Done, and more. To get started, see [Kanban quickstart](../boards/kanban-quickstart.md).

## Customize your Kanban board

Your Kanban board is highly customizable to support your team's workflow. 

The main steps you'll typically want to follow are outlined below. 

[![Configure Kanban board](../backlogs/_img/overview/gs-planning-configure-kanban.png)](kanban-basics.md)[![Update the Kanban board](../backlogs/_img/overview/gs-planning-track-kanban.png)](kanban-basics.md)[![Monitor progress](../backlogs/_img/overview/gs-planning-monitor-kanban.png)](../../report/dashboards/cumulative-flow.md)

## Update work item status
::: moniker range=">= tfs-2015"
Once you've configured your Kanban board, you can add work items directly to the board. You can then update the status of work by dragging a card to another column on the Kanban board. You can even change the order of items as you move a card to a new column.
