# Default permissions and access set for collaboration tools 

**Azure DevOps Services | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017**

Collaboration tools encompass READMEs, team project Wikis, notifications, feedback, and semantic search.  

Most of these tools are available to you if you are added as a team member or a member of the Contributors group for a team project. The most common built-in groups include Readers, Contributors, and Project Administrators. For a simplified view of all default permissions assigned to built-in groups, see [Default permissions and access](../../organizations/security/permissions-access.md).  

Stakeholders have limited access to view charts and dashboards. To learn more, see [About access levels](../../organizations/security/access-levels.md).

## Manage permissions

To manage permissions for a collaboration tool, see these topics:
- [Manage README & Wiki permissions (security)](manage-readme-wiki-permissions.md?toc=/azure/devops/project/wiki/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/project/wiki/breadcrumb/toc.json)
- [Set feedback permissions](../feedback/give-permissions-feedback.md?toc=/azure/devops/project/feedback/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/project/wiki/project/feedback/toc.json )

To manage notifications, see: 
- [Manage personal notifications](../../notifications/howto-manage-personal-notifications.md?toc=/azure/devops/notifications/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/notifications/breadcrumb/toc.json)
- [Manage team notifications](../../notifications/howto-manage-team-notifications.md?toc=/azure/devops/notifications/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/notifications/breadcrumb/toc.json) 

>[!NOTE]
>There are no UI permissions associated with managing notifications. Instead, you can manage them using the [TFSSecurity command line tool](/tfs/server/ref/command-line/tfssecurity-cmd#collection-level-permissions).
