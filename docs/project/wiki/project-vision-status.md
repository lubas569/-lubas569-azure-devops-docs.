# Share your project vision, view project activity

From the project summary page, you can share your project vision with your team, add project members, and check the latest project activity. You can share your project vision and objective, as well as ways for team members to contribute to the project through a project README file or through a project wiki.  

If you want to use a project wiki, then you'll want to first [Create a Wiki for your project](wiki-create-repo.md). You can then [change the project summary page to point to the wiki](#change-repo).

From the project home page, you can share your project vision with your team, add project members, and check the latest project activity. You can share your project vision and objective, as well as ways for team members to contribute to the project through a project README file.

> [!NOTE]    
> The features and functions available from your project page depend on the source control&#151;Git or Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC)&#151;that you selected when you [created your team project](../../organizations/projects/create-project.md).  
::: moniker-end  

## Prerequisites

- To edit information on the project page, change the repository used to share your project vision. or manage project membership, you must be a member of the [Project Administrators group](../../organizations/security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md) or have your **Edit project-level information** permission set to **Allow**. 
- To edit a page, you must be a contributor to the repository or branch or have the **Contribute** permissions set to **Allow**.  
- To view the project page, you must be a valid member of the project. For more information, see [Permissions and groups, Valid user groups](../../organizations/security/about-permissions.md#validusers).

## Open Project summary 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/new-navigation.md)]  

# [New navigation](#tab/new-nav)  

::: moniker range="vsts"  
  
From your web browser, choose **Overview>Summary**. If you don't have a  project yet, [create a project](../../organizations/projects/create-project.md).   

If you haven't set up your project summary yet, you'll see this welcome page: 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Open project summary, new nav](_img/share-project/welcome-page-new-nav.png)  

You can select one of the following tasks to get started: 
- **Invite** to begin [adding others to your project](../../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md). Note, you can only invite users who have already been [added to your organization](../../organizations/accounts/add-team-members-vs.md). 
- **Boards** to begin [adding work items](../../boards/work-items/view-add-work-items.md).
- **Repos** to open [Repos>Files](../../repos/git/clone.md) page where you can clone or import a repository, or [initialize a README file](#initialize-readme) for your project summary page.
- **Pipelines** to start [defining a pipeline](../../pipelines/index.md).
- **Test Plans** to start [defining test plans and test suites](../../test/create-a-test-plan.md).
- [Manage your services](../../organizations/settings/set-services.md) to disable the visibility of one or more services.

To support your project vision, you can choose a README file that you maintain in a project repository, or the [project Wiki](wiki-create-repo.md). To choose between a README file or a Wiki, see [Change the repository](#change-repo). To define a README file for your project, see [Initialize a README file for your Git repo](#initialize-git) or [Initialize a README file for your TFVC repo](#initialize-tfvc).

## Initialize a README file for a Git repo

You can share your project vision and objective, as well as ways for team members to contribute to the project through a project README file. For Git projects, the README.md file needs to be at the root of each repository in the default branch. For Git based projects the left pane supports navigation to other repositories. A separate Welcome page/README.md file can be created for each repository.  

# [New navigation](#tab/new-nav)  

::: moniker range="vsts"  

0. Open **Repos>Files**. This page guides you to get started quickly by adding code to your repository when you choose one of the options to clone, push, import, or simply initialize a repo.  

0. With the **Add a README** check box checked, choose **Initialize**. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Initialize README file, new nav](_img/share-project/initialize-readme-new-nav.png)

	A default README file is added to the project repository, in this case, the **Fabrikam Test** repo.

0.	Return to **Overview>Summary** and choose the README file for the project page. Choose the ![](../../_img/icons/edit.png) edit icon.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Choose README file, new nav](_img/share-project/choose-readme-file-new-nav.png)  

0. Select the project repository where you initialized the README file. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Choose Repository where the README file exists, new nav](_img/share-project/choose-readme-file-dialog-new-nav.png)  

0. To edit the README file, choose the README file link. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Edit the README file, new nav](_img/share-project/edit-readme-file.png)  

	You'll be directed to the **Repos>Files** page for the README file. You can edit and modify the README markdown file like you would any other file in a Git repository. You can use Markdown language to format the README file and add images. To learn more about adding a README file, see [Create a README for your repo](../../repos/git/create-a-readme.md) and [Markdown guidance](../wiki/markdown-guidance.md).

0. To add another page, simply enter a link to a new Markdown file that doesn't yet exist, for example:
 
	`[page-1](./page-1.md)`
