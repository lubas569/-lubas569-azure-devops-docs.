# Enable preview features 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-only.md)] 

As new features are introduced, you can turn them on or off. That way, you can try them out, provide feedback, and work with those features that meet your requirements.  

Some features provide a new user interface and functionality, which can be managed per user or team member. Others support a default experience for the account and are managed by an account administrator. 
 
> [!NOTE]   
> You can turn on or off select features for Azure DevOps Services. Preview features become available first on Azure DevOps Services and then become standard features with an update to TFS. At some point, the preview feature moves out of preview status and becomes a regular feature of the web portal.

## Enable features at the organization (account) level (for all users)  

When you enable a feature at the organization level, you essentially turn it on for all users of your account. Each user can then disable the feature if they so choose.

> [!TIP]  
> If you don't see the **for this account** menu option, then you aren't an account administrator. To get added as one, see [Add administrators, set permissions at the team project or collection level](../../organizations/security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md).
