If you have more than one Azure subscription for this customer, use the dropdown to choose the Azure subscription for which 
you made the purchases.  The **License Summary** shows you the number of subscriptions that have been assigned and how many 
are available for each Visual Studio cloud subscription.  The summary also allows you to purchase additional subscriptions 
or reduce the number of subscriptions.

Choose **add** to assign a subscription to a new user.  The displayed count updates, and the Partner Center sends 
the end user receives an email notification.  The end user can then log in using the email address you provided.

To reassign a license, you can delete the current subscriber and add a new subscriber, or you can edit a subscriber 
to change the user to which you assigned the.

If a subscriber hasn't activated their subscription, they may have missed the invitation email.  You can resend the 
activation invitation to the email address you provided.

>[!NOTE]
> Visual Studio subscribers qualify for dev/test pricing. After you assign the Visual Studio subscription to the end user, 
> and that end user activates, then this activated Visual Studio subscriber can create a new Azure subscription for their own use  
> which includes a monthly credit that can be used for running Azure resources for dev/test. See 
> [monthly Azure credits for Visual Studio subscribers](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/credit-for-visual-studio-subscribers/)
>
> Separately, we also offer a way for customers to use Azure across their team with dev/test pricing.  
> Point customers to [Azure dev/test pricing](http://aka.ms/azuredevtestpricing) to learn about options. We do not have a way for 
> CSPs to offer Azure dev/test pricing to their customers; the customers must sign up for this directly with Microsoft.
