#  VSTS extensions

An extension is an installable unit that contributes new capabilities into VSTS and/or Team Foundation Server. There are both free and paid extensions offered by Microsoft and from other parties.

## Free extensions 

There are many free extensions available in the Visual Studio Marketplace, too numerous to list. However, the following extensions are listed as they quickly add a lot of value and are easily installed. 

- [Work Item Search](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-workitem-search)

## Create your own extensions
Create your own extensions, for your use alone or by the community. Extending VSTS is the easiest way for users to get the most out of their 
devops environment. The [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com) is home to hundreds of extensions
that can be installed to help with:
- Planning and tracking of work items, sprints, scrums, etc. 
- Build and release flows
- Code testing and tracking
- Collaboration amongst team members

Adding extensions to your VSTS account is incredibly easy:

2. Install the extension from the Visual Studio Marketplace and start using it in VSTS or TFS.
You can install extension with a few clicks. You must have administrative permissions to upload or install extensions.
