#	Buy Visual Studio Professional and Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions

You can buy [Visual Studio Professional and Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions](https://www.visualstudio.com/subscriptions/) 
from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com). 
These are what we call cloud subscriptions. [Compare cloud subscription benefits and pricing](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/pricing/).

## Before you start

*	To bill your purchases, you'll need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/). 
You can [sign up](https://portal.azure.com) 
before your first purchase or during your first purchase in the Visual Studio Marketplace.
Learn [which Azure subscriptions you can use for Visual Studio Marketplace purchases](../faq-azure-billing.md#billing). 

*	To sign up for your Azure subscription and buy from the Visual Studio Marketplace, 
you'll need a ["personal" Microsoft account](https://www.microsoft.com/account) 
or a ["work or school account"](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/sign-up-organization/) 
if you're buying for your organization, and they manage identities with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
