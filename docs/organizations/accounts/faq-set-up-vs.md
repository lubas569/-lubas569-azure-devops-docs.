### Q: Why do I need to sign in?

A: Your Visual Studio settings, 
like automatic brace completion, 
are saved with your profile. 
These settings roam with your [personal Microsoft account](https://www.microsoft.com/account), 
or your [work or school account](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/sign-up-organization/), 
when you sign in to Visual Studio on any computer. 

Sign in to Visual Studio during the 30-day 
trial period for these benefits:

*    Visual Studio Enterprise: Extend your trial for 90 days. When your trial expires, 
learn [how to unlock Visual Studio](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn950037.aspx).
*    Visual Studio Express or Community: Continue to use this edition for free.

When you create your profile, you can also create an organization.

that's managed by Azure Active Directory.

* Visual Studio 2019
* Visual Studio 2017
* Visual Studio 2015
* Visual Studio 2013
* Visual Studio 2012

and [KB2662296](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2662296)
* Visual Studio 2008 SP1, which requires a [GDR update](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2673642)

### Q: Can I use Visual Studio 2015 with Visual Studio 2013 and 2012 on the same computer?

### Q: Can I use earlier versions of Visual Studio to connect to Azure DevOps?
