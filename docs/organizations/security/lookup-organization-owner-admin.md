# Look up administrators or an organization owner 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../includes/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

An administrator or organization Owner can give you access to select features or functions, or change your permissions. In this article, learn how to look up administrators or organization Owners.

For an overview of built-in security groups and default permission assignments, see [Default permissions and access](permissions-access.md).

## Prerequisites

* You must have a project. If you don't have a project yet, [create one](../projects/create-project.md).  
* You must be a member of the Project Valid Users Group or Project Collection Valid Users Group to view permissions. Users added to a project are automatically added to these security groups. 

## Show members of the Project Administrators group

Choose the Project Administrators group from the **Project Settings > Permissions** page to see members. If you want to be a Project Administrator, have your current administrator add you.

> [!NOTE]   
> To enable the new user interface for the Project Permissions Settings Page, see [Enable preview features](../../project/navigation/preview-features.md).

#### [Preview page](#tab/preview-page) 

1. Open the web portal and choose your project. To choose another project, see [Switch project, repository, team](../../project/navigation/go-to-project-repo.md).

2. Choose **Project settings**, and then **Permissions**.

3. Choose **Project Administrators** group, and then **Members**.  

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Project Settings, Permissions page, Add member](media/project-collection/project-admin-members-tab-s154.png) 

4. Enter the name of the user account into the text box and then select from the match that appears. You can enter several identities recognized by the system into the **Add users and/or groups** box. The system automatically searches for matches. Choose the matches that meet your choices.

	> ![Add users and group dialog](media/project-collection/add-member-project-admin.png)  

	> [!NOTE]   
	> Users that have limited access, such as Stakeholders, won't be able to access select features even if granted permissions to those features. To learn more, see [Permissions and access](permissions-access.md).

5. Choose **Save**. 

#### [Current page](#tab/current-page) 

1. Open the web portal and choose your project. To choose another project, see [Switch project, repository, team](../../project/navigation/go-to-project-repo.md).

2. Choose **Project Settings**, and then **Security**.

## Show members of the Project Collection Administrators group

If you need elevated permissions, request them from a member of the [Project Collection Administrators group](set-project-collection-level-permissions.md). Project collection administrators manage features and functions that impact all projects.

To find out who is a member of the Project Collection Administrators group, check the **Permissions** settings at the collection level. 

> [!NOTE]

1. Choose the ![project-icon.png](../../media/icons/project-icon.png) Azure DevOps logo to open your projects, and then choose ![gear icon](../../media/icons/gear-icon.png) **Organization settings**.
