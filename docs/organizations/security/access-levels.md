# About access levels

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

Access levels grant or restrict access to select web portal features. This is in addition to permissions granted through security groups which provide or restrict specific tasks. Access levels enable administrators to provide their user base access to the features they need and only pay for those features. 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-selector.md)]

When you add a user or group to a team or project, they're automatically granted access to those features supported by the default access level and those supported by the security group to which they are added. Most users can access most features by being assigned to the **Basic** access level and **Contributors** security group. For a simplified overview of the permissions assigned to the most common groups&#151;**Readers**, **Contributors**, and **Project Administrators**&#151;as well as the **Stakeholder** access group, see [Permissions and access](permissions-access.md).  

::: moniker range="vsts"
To add user accounts or groups to specific access levels, see [Manage users and access](../accounts/add-organization-users.md). Make sure to set each user's access level based on what you've purchased for that user.
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= azdevserver-2019"
To add user accounts or groups to specific access levels, see [Change access levels](change-access-levels.md). Make sure to set each user's access level based on what you've purchased for that user. 
::: moniker-end

## Supported access levels 

You assign users or groups of users to one of the following access levels:

::: moniker range="vsts"
- **Stakeholders**: Provides partial access, can be assigned to unlimited users for free. Assign to users with no license or subscriptions who need access to a limited set of features.
- **Basic**: Provides access to most features. Assign to users with a TFS CAL, with a Visual Studio Professional subscription, and to users for whom you are paying for Azure Boards & Repos in an organization. 
- **Visual Studio Subscription**: provides access to premium features and all published DevOps extensions. Assign to users with a Visual Studio Enterprise subscription.

- **Basic**: Provides access to most features. Assign  to users with a TFS CAL or with a Visual Studio subscription. 
- **VS Enterprise** (TFS 2017.1): Provides access to premium features. Assign to users with a subscription to Visual Studio Enterprise.
- **Advanced** (TFS 2017): Provides access to premium features. Only assign to users with a subscription to MSDN Platforms or Visual Studio Test Professional.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= tfs-2015"
- **Stakeholders**: Provides partial access, can be assigned to unlimited users for free. Assign to users with no license or subscriptions who need access to a limited set of features.
- **Basic**: Provides access to most features  
- **Advanced**: Provides access to premium features. Assign to users with a subscription to Visual Studio Enterprise, Visual Studio Test Professional or MSDN Platforms.

### Public versus private feature access
**Stakeholder** access grants access to features differently depending on whether you're working from a private or a public project. To learn more about public projects, see [What is a public project?](../public/about-public-projects.md).  

| Service, application, or setting | Private project | Public project|
|------------|-----------------|---------------|
|**Dashboards** | Partial access | Full access | 
|**Wiki** | Partial access | Full access | 
|**Boards (Work)** | Partial access | Full access | 
|**Repos (Code)**| No access | Full access | 
|**Pipelines (Build and Release)** | Full access | Full access | 
|**Test Plans (Test)** | No access | No access | 
|**Notifications** | Full access | Full access | 
|**Semantic search** | Full access | Full access | 
|**Project settings** | Partial access | Partial access | 
|**Organization settings** | Partial access | Partial access |

For TFS 2017 and earlier versions, you should assign the **Advanced** level to those users for whom you've purchased the full Test feature set. Here are the purchasing options:  
- Higher-level Visual Studio subscriptions: Visual Studio Test Professional, Visual Studio Enterprise, or MSDN Platforms subscriptions.
These include a TFS CAL plus the rights to access the full set of Test features.  
- A paid Azure DevOps user (which includes a TFS CAL) plus the [Test Manager extension for Azure Test Plans](#test-manager). 

For TFS 2017.2, Assign **Advanced** access to those users for whom you've purchased MSDN Platforms or Visual Studio Test Professional subscriptions. These include a TFS CAL plus the rights to access Test Manager. To learn more, see [Get extensions for TFS, Assign paid extension access to users](../../marketplace/how-to/assign-paid-extension-access.md).
	

> [!NOTE]

If you are on TFS 2017.1 and have users with Visual Studio Test Professional or MSDN Platforms subscriptions, you should assign them Basic access level. In addition, you need to open **Users** for the project collections in which they are a member and [assign them the Test Manager extension for Azure Test Plans](../../marketplace/assign-paid-extensions.md).

## What features can users access who are added to two different groups?
If a user belongs to a group that has **Basic** access and another group that has **VS Enterprise** access, the user has access to all features available through **VS Enterprise**, which is a superset of **Basic**.

## Service account access  
Azure DevOps Server and TFS [service accounts](/tfs/tfs-server/admin/service-accounts-dependencies-tfs) are added to the default access level. If you make Stakeholder the default access level, you must add the service accounts to Basic or Advanced/VS Enterprise access.  

Service accounts don't require a TFS CAL or other purchase.
