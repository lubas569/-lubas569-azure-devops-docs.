# View build and release pipelines 

[!INCLUDE [temp](_shared/version-public-projects.md)]  

When viewing a public project, you can view the status of build and release pipelines and their definitions. If you're a contributor, you can also [define build pipelines](../../pipelines/build/ci-public.md?toc=/vsts/organizations/public/toc.json&bc=/vsts/organizations/public/breadcrumb/toc.json).  

[!INCLUDE [temp](_shared/anon-user.md)]   

## View recent builds and build pipelines  

[!INCLUDE [temp](_shared/navigation.md)] 

# [Horizontal navigation](#tab/horizontal)  

To view the status of recent builds, choose **Build and Release**.  To view a summary or history of any build, choose a build. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

## View active release pipelines and definitions 

# [Horizontal navigation](#tab/horizontal)  

To view active release pipelines, choose **Build and Release>Releases**. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Build and Release hub, Recent releases page ](_img/pipelines/view-releases.png)

From there, you can drill into the details of a release. For example, here we show the **Release-3** pipeline.
