> Choose **Previous navigation** when you see a top-level, blue-bar. If you see a vertical sidebar or if you enabled **New Navigation**, choose **New navigation**. The vertical sidebar along with other navigational changes are enabled when the **New Navigation** preview feature is enabled for the signed-in user or the VSTS account. For more information on **New Navigation**, see this [blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2018/06/19/new-navigation/).
