> [!NOTE]
> Choose **Horizontal navigation** when you see a top-level, blue-bar. If you see a vertical sidebar or if you elected to enable **New Navigation**, choose **Vertical navigation**. The vertical sidebar along with other navigational changes are enabled when the **New Navigation** preview feature has been enabled for the signed-in user or the VSTS account. For more information on New Navigation, see this [blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2018/06/19/new-navigation/).
