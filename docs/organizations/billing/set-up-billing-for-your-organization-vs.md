# Set up billing for your organization

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-only](../../includes/version-vsts-only.md)]

In this article, learn to set up billing for your organization. Do so before making purchases, so you have it in place once you're ready to buy.

*All services are billed via Azure*. You're not required to use any other Azure services.

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create one](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/).
* To set up billing, you must have [Project Collection Administrator or organization Owner permissions](../security/lookup-organization-owner-admin.md).
