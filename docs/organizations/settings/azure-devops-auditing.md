# Quickstart: Access, export, and filter audit logs

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-only](../../includes/version-vsts-only.md)]

> [!Note]
> Auditing is currently in a Public Preview.

In this quickstart, learn how to access, export, and filter audit logs. Audit logs contain many changes that occur throughout an Azure DevOps organization. Changes occur when a user or service identity within the organization edits the state of an artifact. 

Audit events can be the following occurrences:
- permissions changes
- deleted resources
- branch policy changes
- accessing the auditing feature
- and much more

Auditing is turned on by default for all Azure DevOps organizations. You can't turn auditing off, which ensures that you never miss an actionable event. Events get stored for 90 days and then they’re deleted. However, you can back up audit events to an external location to keep the data for longer than the 90-day period. 

## Prerequisites

By default, Project Collection Administrators are the only group that have access to the auditing feature. 

## Access auditing

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

> [!NOTE]   
> To enable the new user interface for the Project Permissions Settings Page, see [Enable preview features](../../project/navigation/preview-features.md).

#### [Preview page](#tab/preview-page) 

1. Sign in to your organization (```https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}```).
2. Select ![gear icon](../../media/icons/gear-icon.png) **Organization settings**. 
   ![Open Organization settings](../../media/settings/open-admin-settings-vert.png)
3. Select **Auditing**.

   ![Auditing](media/azure-devops-auditing/AccessAuditLogRedBox-preview.png)
   If you don't see Auditing in Organization settings, then you don't have access to view audit events. Outside of the Project Collection Administrators group, you can give permissions to other users and groups, so they can view auditing.
4. Select **Permissions**, and then find the group or users to provide auditing access to.

   ![Select Permissions to provide audit access](media/azure-devops-auditing/select-permissions-preview.png)

## Review audit log

The auditing page provides a simple view into the audit events recorded for your organization. You can only search by time range to find audit events that occurred within the last 90 days. 

See the following description of the information that's visible on the auditing page.

### Audit event information and details

|Information  |Details  |
|---------|---------|
|Actor     | Display name of the individual that triggered the audit event.      |
|IP    |  IP address of the individual that triggered the audit event.    |
|Timestamp     | Time that the triggered event happened. Time is localized to your time zone.        |
|Area     | Location in Azure DevOps where the event occurred.        |
|Category     | Description of the type of action that occurred. For example, modify, rename, create, delete, remove, execute, and access.   | 
|Details    | Brief description of what happened during the event.        |


Each audit event records additional information to what's viewable on the auditing page. This information includes the authentication mechanism, a correlation ID to link similar events together, user agent, and additional information that’s dependent on the type of audit event. This information can only be viewed by downloading auditing events.

To scope down the viewable audit events, select the time filter on the top-right-hand side of the page. 

![Auditing entry filter by date & time](media/azure-devops-auditing/AuditLogDateTimePicker.png)

You can select any time range over the last 90 days and scope it down to the minute. Once you’ve selected a time range, select anywhere off the time range selector to start the search. By default, the top 200 results are returned for that time selection. If there are more results, then you can scroll down to load them onto the page. If you wish to further scope down the set of results returned, then you need to download the auditing data.

Some audit events can contain multiple actions that took place at once, known as bulk audit events. You can distinguish these events from others with the information icon on the far right of the event. 

![Auditing more information icon](media/azure-devops-auditing/AuditLogMoreInformationHighRes.png)

Selecting the information icon displays additional information about what happened in this audit event.


## Export auditing events

To do a more detailed search of the auditing data, or store more than 90 days of data, you need to export existing audit events. The exported data can then be stored in another location or service. 

Select the **Download** button in the top-right-hand side of the auditing page to export auditing events. You can select to download as a CSV or JSON file. 

Selecting either option starts the download. Events get downloaded based on the time range you've selected in the filter. If you had one day selected, then you get that one day’s worth of data. Transversely, if you wanted all 90 days, select 90 days from the time range filter and then start the download. 

## Filter audit log

You can search audit events by time range in Azure DevOps. Other, more detailed types of searches require other tools after exporting your audit event data. 

We recommend you download the logs as CSV files for quick investigations. You can then use Microsoft Excel or other CSV parsers to quickly filter on the area and category columns. In longer term investigations, we recommend you place your exported audit events in a Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM) tool. The tool allows you to keep greater than 90 days of events, searches, generated reports, and configured alerts based on audit events. 

When you filter through audit events, it’s best to use the *area* and *category* columns. These columns allow you to quickly filter down to only the types of events that you’re interested in. The following tables have a list of areas and categories, and their descriptions. 

### Categories


|Category  |Description |
|---------|---------|
|Modify     | A changed artifact, which could be a state or property change, in an organization.        |
|Rename     | Artifact had its name changed in an organization.        |
|Create     | Newly created artifacts in an organization.        |
|Delete     | Deleted or removed artifacts from an organization.        |
|Access     | Viewed or opened artifacts in an organization.        |
 
### Areas

> [!Note]
> While auditing is in a public preview, we're working hard to get more areas audited. We're adding new auditing events monthly.
>
> If you can't find the auditing event you're looking for in the following table, be sure to check the REST API: https:\//auditservice.dev.azure.com/{YOUR_ORGANIZATION}/_apis/audit/actions. Replace {YOUR_ORGANIZATION} with the name of your organization. The API shows a list of all audit events your organization could emit.

### Filtering tips

Once you've downloaded a copy of your auditing events, you can see the additional information with each event. See the following useful tips for how to filter through events beyond using only the categories and areas fields. 

**ID & correlation ID**

Each audit event has unique identifiers called the “ID” and “CorrelationID”. The correlation ID is helpful for finding related audit events. For example, a created project can generate several dozen audit events. You can link these events together because they all have the same correlation ID. 

When an audit event ID matches its correlation ID, it indicates that the audit event is the parent or original event. So, the initial event, showing that a user created a project, has the same ID as the correlation ID. To see only originating events, you can set a filter where “ID” equals the “Correlation ID”. Then, if you find an event that you want to investigate, you can search for only events with that correlation ID. Not all events have other related events. 

## Limitations

The following limitations exist for what can be audited. 

* Azure AD group membership changes – In the future, auditing will include changes to Azure DevOps groups, such as adding or removing a group or user. However, if you manage membership via Azure AD groups, additions and removals of users from those Azure AD groups aren't audited by Azure DevOps. Review the Azure AD audit logs to see when a user or group was added or removed from an Azure AD group. 
* Signing in – We don't track sign in events for Azure DevOps. View the Azure AD audit logs to review sign in events to your Azure AD.
