# Agile to Scrum

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../../_shared/version-vsts-only.md)]

> [!WARNING]     
> If you have existing work items, this process requires manual updates to work items and board configuration. Please make sure you follow the below steps and images before attempting to change the process used by a project.

## Steps

1. [Create a custom process](./manage-process.md) under Scrum called "Scrum - Inherited".

2. If the work item types are being used by your project then [add the work item type](./customize-process-wit.md) User Story and Issue to the "Scrum - Inherited" process.  

  > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
  > ![Scrum Inherited WITs](_img/change-process/scrum-inherited-wits.png)

3. Run the Change Process Wizard by going to Organization Settings > Process. Select the process that contains the project you want to change. For example, Agile. Click on the Projects tab and hover over the project. Click the ... context menu and select "Change Process". Follow the steps in the wizard.

4. Update the [board settings](../../../boards/get-started/customize-boards.md) for each board so that the column to state mapping is correct.

  > ![Board Configuration](_img/change-process/change-process-agile-to-scrum-board-config.gif)

5. [Create a query](../../../boards/queries/using-queries.md) to get a list of all User Stories. Sort the list by state value. Highlight all User Stories and do a [change type](../../../boards/backlogs/remove-delete-work-items.md#change-the-work-item-type) to Product Backlog Item. Next do a [bulk edit](../../../boards/backlogs/bulk-modify-work-items.md) to update work items to the right state for the Product Backlog Item type. For example: Active would change to Committed. Do this for each state, one state at a time.

6. Adjust query to show only Issues. Highlight all Issue work items and a change type to be an Impediment. Do a bulk edit to update work items to the right state for the Impediment type. Do this for each state, one state at a time.

7. Adjust query to only show Tasks. Use bulk edit to update state value for all Tasks, one state at a time. Rinse and repeat the same process for Bugs, Epics, and Features.

  > ![Update Work Items](_img/change-process/change-process-agile-to-scrum-update-work-items.gif)

8. [Change the process used by the project](./manage-process.md#change-the-process-used-by-a-project) to use the system Scrum process
