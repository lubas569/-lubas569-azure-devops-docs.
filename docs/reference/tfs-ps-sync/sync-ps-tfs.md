# Synchronize TFS with Project Server, third-party support  

<b>TFS 2017 | [TFS 2015 | TFS 2013](synchronize-tfs-project-server.md)</b>

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> TFS 2017 and later versions no longer support native integration with Office Project Server. If you work with on-premises TFS 2015 or TFS 2013, see [Synchronize TFS with Project Server](synchronize-tfs-project-server.md).

If you're using an earlier version of Team Foundation Server and native integration is installed and configured, native integration won't work after you upgrade to TFS 2017 or a later version.

For more information about why we no longer support this integration, read the blog post [Microsoft discontinuing Project Server/TFS Integration. Partner to provide solution](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/microsoft-discontinuing-project-server-tfs-integration/).

## [Tasktop](https://www.tasktop.com/product-overview)
 
Tasktop provides enterprise-grade integration between Microsoft Project Server and Azure DevOps Services and TFS, as well as to most other popular Agile, DevOps and Systems Development Lifecycle (SDLC) tools. This integration automates the flow of artifacts (such as work items and tasks) across these tools, eliminating wasted time and bottlenecks while increasing velocity, collaboration and even employee satisfaction! In addition, Tasktop can automatically collect the activity data into a central database, enabling the creation of consolidated dashboards and reports, allowing for greater project visibility and artifact traceability. 
 
[Tasktop's unique model-based integration approach](https://www.tasktop.com/product-overview) dramatically reduces the time and effort it takes to integrate tools. This approach is especially important for larger organizations with many tools (and tool instances), hundreds of projects within those tools, thousands of users, and millions of work items and tasks.

## Remove TFS-Project Server integration for a TFS instance upgraded to TFS 2017  

When you upgrade TFS 2015 or earlier version, which has the native TFS-Project Server integration configured, remnants of the integration remain. You may choose to ignore them, or you can remove them to avoid receiving error messages. See [Remove integration of TFS with Project Server](remove-tfs-ps-integration.md).
