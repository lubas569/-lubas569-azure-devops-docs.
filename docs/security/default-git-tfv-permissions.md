# Default build and release permissions 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

You can define and manage your builds and releases from the web portal, **Build and Release** hub. For an overview of build and release management features and functions, see [Continuous integration on any platform](../build-release/overview.md). 

Permissions for build and release functions are set at the object-level for a specific build or release. In addition, there are build permissions set at the  collection level. You grant or restrict permissions by setting the permission state to Allow or Deny, either for a security group or an individual user.  To set permissions, see [Set build and release permissions](set-build-release-permissions.md).
