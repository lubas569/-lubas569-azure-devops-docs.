# Set build and release permissions 

[!INCLUDEÂ [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

Permissions for build and release functions are set at the object-level for a specific build or release. In addition, there are build permissions set at the  collection level. You grant or restrict permissions by setting the permission state to Allow or Deny, either for a security group or an individual user. 

For definitions of each build and release permission, see [Build and release permissions](../build-release/concepts/policies/permissions.md). 

## Set the permissions for a build definition  

1. From the web portal **Build-Release** hub, **Builds** page, open the Security dialog for a build definition.

	<img src="_img/set-build-permission-open-dialog.png" alt="Open the security dialog for a build definition" style="border: 1px solid #C3C3C3;" />

2. Choose the group you want to set permissions for, and then change the permission setting to Allow or Deny. 

	For example, here we change the permission for Edit build definition for the Contributors group to Allow. 

	<img src="_img/set-build-permission-dialog.png" alt="Security dialog for a build definition" style="border: 1px solid #C3C3C3;" />

3. Save your changes. 

## Set the permissions for all release definitions or a specific release definition   

1. From the web portal **Build-Release** hub, **Releases** page, open the Security dialog for all release definitions.

	<img src="_img/set-release-permission-open-dialog.png" alt="Open the security dialog for a build definition" style="border: 1px solid #C3C3C3;" />

	If you want to manage the permissions for a specific release, then open the Security dialog for that release. 

2. Choose the group you want to set permissions for, and then change the permission setting to Allow or Deny. 

	For example, here we deny access to several permissions for the Contributors group. 

	<img src="_img/set-release-permission-dialog.png" alt="Security dialog for a release definition" style="border: 1px solid #C3C3C3;" />

3. Save your changes. 
 
## Set collection-level permissions to administer build resources
 
0. From the web portal user context, open the admin context by clicking the ![](../work/_img/icons/gear_icon.png) gear Settings icon and choosing Account or Collection settings.

0. Click Security, and then choose the group whose permissions you want to modify. 

	Here we choose the Build Administrators group and change the **Use build resources** permission. 

	<img src="_img/set-build-collection-level-permission-dialog.png" alt="Security dialog for Project Collection Build Administrators group" style="border: 1px solid #C3C3C3;" />

0. Save your changes.
