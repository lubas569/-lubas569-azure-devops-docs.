The local path on the agent where any artifacts are copied to before being pushed to their destination. For example: `c:\agent\_work\1\a`<br /><br />A typical way to use this folder is to publish your build artifacts with the [Copy files](../../../../tasks/utility/copy-files.md) and [Publish build artifacts](../../../../tasks/utility/publish-build-artifacts.md) steps.<br /><br />**Note:** This directory is purged before each new build, so you don't have to clean it up yourself.<br /><br />Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory and Build.StagingDirectory are interchangeable.<br /><br />See [Artifacts in Team Build](../artifacts.md)
