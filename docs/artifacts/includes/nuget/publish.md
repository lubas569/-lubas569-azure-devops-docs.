Publish NuGet packages to a feed in Azure Artifacts to share them with your team and your organization.

First, get the tools and your feed URL:

[!INCLUDE [](nuget-publish-endpoint.md)]

### Install and publish a sample NuGet package  

If you don't have a package but want to try publishing, you can install a NuGet sample package from the public NuGet gallery.

1. Install the sample NuGet package:

   ```Command
   nuget install HelloWorld -ExcludeVersion
   ```

1. Publish the sample NuGet package to your feed.

   Run these two commands in an elevated command prompt to add the source to your nuget.config file and push your package to your feed. Replace the placeholders with the respective values.

   ```Command
   nuget sources add -Name <SourceName> -Source <SourceURL> -username <UserName> -password <Pat>
   nuget push -Source <SourceName> -ApiKey az <PackagePath exp:(.\Get-Hello.1.0.0.nupkg)>
   ```

### Create and publish your own NuGet package

1. Create your own NuGet package by following the steps in [Create NuGet packages](/nuget/create-packages/creating-a-package).

1. Publish your package to your feed.

   Run these two commands in an elevated command prompt to add the source to your nuget.config file and push your package to your feed. Replace the placeholders with the respective values.

   ```Command
   nuget sources add -Name <SourceName> -Source <SourceURL> -username <UserName> -password <Pat>
