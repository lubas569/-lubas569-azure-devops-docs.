Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) using the instructions [here](../../organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate.md). Scope your PAT to the organization(s) you want to access and to one of the following scopes: *Packaging (read)*, *Packaging (read and write)*, or *Packaging (read, write, and manage).*

> We strongly recommend **not checking your PAT into source control**; anyone with access to your PAT can interact with Azure DevOps Services as you.
