# About feedback

**VSTS | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015 | TFS 2013**  


Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) and Team Foundation Server (TFS) provide two main methods for collecting feedback on your work apps. You can use of these two clients to collect feedback: 

- Test & Feedback extension, a web-based client
- Microsoft Feedback client, a free download users install on their local computer. 

To request feedback, you use these methods: 
- From within the work item form for a user story or product backlog item, as shown in the following image:<br/>![Request feedback from the Test & Feedback extension](/vsts/manual-test/stakeholder/_img/request-stakeholder-feedback/request-stakeholder-feedback-01.png) 
- From the dashboard widget that contains other links, as shown:<br/>![Request feedback from the dashboard](/vsts/feedback/_img/request-feedback-link.png)

Both tools generate a Feedback Request work item. Each response provided by a stakeholder generates a Feedback Response work item. You can then track requests and responses easily from the **Work>Queries** page.

To provide feedback about VSTS or TFS, see [Provide product and content feedback](/vsts/user-guide/provide-feedback?toc=/vsts/feedback/toc.json&bc=/vsts/feedback/breadcrumb/toc.json).
