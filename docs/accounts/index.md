# Account Management 

**VSTS**

Sign up for a VSTS account, add users, and manage permissions and access.


## 5-Minute Quickstarts  

* [Create your VSTS account](create-account-msa-or-work-student.md)
<!-- Can't add "add user" which is really obvious quick start item because it must then be in the quick starts in
     the toc, and there's a rule that you must not duplicate TOC entries for browsing.  There is a hard call here that
     users are more likely to ignore quick starts after first blush usage, so they are more likely to find adding users
     in the How-to Guides section.  The ripple effect is that truly new users using the index page won't be guided as
     well as repeat users who need to find common tasks readily if they are browsing.
