# Manage organization notification settings

<b>Azure DevOps Services | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017.1 | [Previous versions](../work/track/alerts-and-notifications.md)</b>

> [!NOTE]  
> This topic applies to Azure DevOps Services, TFS 2017 Update 1, and later versions. If you work from an on-premises TFS 2017 or earlier versions, see [Set alerts, get notified when changes occur](../work/track/alerts-and-notifications.md). For on-premises TFS, [you must configure an SMTP server](/tfs/server/admin/setup-customize-alerts) in order for team members to see the Notifications option from their organization menu and to receive notifications.

1. [Navigate to the organization notifications settings page](navigating-the-ui.md#navigating-to-the-organization-level-notifications-page).
2. Select the **Settings** tab.
3. Configure the default the delivery setting.
