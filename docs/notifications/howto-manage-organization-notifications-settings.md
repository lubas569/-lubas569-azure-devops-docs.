# Manage organization notification settings

<b>Azure DevOps Services | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017.1 | [Previous versions](../work/track/alerts-and-notifications.md)</b> 

> [!NOTE]  
> This topic applies to Azure DevOps Services, TFS 2017 Update 1, and later versions. If you work from an on-premises TFS 2017 or ealier versions, see [Set alerts, get notified when changes occur](../work/track/alerts-and-notifications.md). For on-premises TFS, [you must configure an SMTP server](/tfs/server/admin/setup-customize-alerts) in order for team members to see the Notifications option from their organization menu and to receive notifications. 

## Manage the default delivery setting
Choose to allow or block delivery of emails for all subscriptions owned by a team or a group. This is a default setting which applies only if the team or group has not explicitly set the option.
