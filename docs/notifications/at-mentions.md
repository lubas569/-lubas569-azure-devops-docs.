# Use &#64;mentions in work items and pull requests

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/version-ts-tfs-2015-2016.md)]

The <strong>@mention</strong> control allows you to quickly add someone into a work item or pull request discussion. You select a project member from the search list and they get notified of the comment you entered. 

Use the <strong>@mention</strong> control to start or continue a discussion within the following areas:

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

- A work item discussion or any rich-text field
- A pull request discussion
- Commit comments
- Changeset or shelveset comments

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2015 < azure-devops"

- A work item discussion 
- A pull request discussion
- Commit comments
- Changeset or shelveset comments

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="tfs-2015"

> [!NOTE]
> The <strong>@mention</strong> control is available from TFS 2015.2 and later versions.

::: moniker-end

<a id="mention-person-id">  </a>

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2015 <= azure-devops-2019"

For team members to receive notifications, [you must configure an SMTP server](/azure/devops/server/admin/setup-customize-alerts).

::: moniker-end

When you're leaving a code comment in a pull request, you can enter **@** to trigger the **@mention** identity picker. From the identity selector, you see a list of the users that you've recently mentioned. Choose one of those names or enter the name of the user you're looking for to do a directory search.  

To filter the list, enter the user name or alias until you've found a match.

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

You can also use group mentions. Enter the name of a team or a security group, choose the search icon, and then select from the options listed.

> [!NOTE]
> For feature availability, check the [Feature Timeline](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/release-notes/features-timeline).

::: moniker-end

To **@mention** a user you've never selected previously, just continue to enter the entire name to do your search against the full directory.  

Names of mentioned users appear in blue text. Choose the **@mention link name** to open the user's contact information. The contact information provides additional context for why they were added to the conversation.  

![Web portal, At mention user contact information accessible](media/at-mention-link-to-user-contact-card.png)  

Upon completion of your selection and text entry, your <strong>@mention</strong> user receives an email alerting them about the mention.  

![Email sent to at-mention user organization](media/mail-to-at-mention-user.png)

Use the **@mention** control in pull request discussions, commit comments, changeset comments, and shelveset comments.

> [!NOTE]
> Do not copy/paste <strong>@mention</strong> users from a previous comment. While the resulting formatting will look identical to a properly entered mention, it will not register as a true mention nor send an email notification.
