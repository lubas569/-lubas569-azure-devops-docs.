# Integrate third-party services

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-tfs-2017-on](../includes/version-tfs-2017-through-vsts.md)]

Integrate with your favorite services by notifying them when events happen in Azure DevOps. See the following examples:

* [Send Azure DevOps notifications to a Slack channel](../service-hooks/services/slack.md)
* [Send Azure DevOps notifications to a Microsoft Teams channel](../service-hooks/services/teams.md)
* [Send Azure DevOps notifications to a Trello board](../service-hooks/services/trello.md)
* [Send Azure DevOps notifications to a HipChat room](../service-hooks/services/hipchat.md)
* [Send Azure DevOps notifications to Azure Service Bus](../service-hooks/services/azure-service-bus.md)

Or, integrate with any endpoint by [Sending Azure DevOps notifications to a generic WebHook](../service-hooks/services/webhooks.md). [Learn about all the integration options](../service-hooks/index.md).
