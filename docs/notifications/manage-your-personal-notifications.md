# Manage your notifications

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-tfs-all-versions](../includes/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

As changes occur to work items, code reviews, source control files, and builds, you can receive email notifications for alerts that you define. For example, you can set an alert to be notified whenever a bug that you opened is resolved or a work item is assigned to you. You can set personal alerts, as described in this article, or [team or project alerts](manage-team-group-notifications.md).

[!INCLUDE [note-earlier-tfs-version](includes/note-earlier-tfs-version.md)]

## Set alerts just for yourself

1. Open alerts management (My alerts from your profile menu). If you don't see this option, then you must [configure an SMTP server to support TFS](/azure/devops/server/admin/setup-customize-alerts). 
	
	![Manage individual alerts from the web portal](media/set-alerts-from-profile-menu.png)

2. Enter one or more email addresses. Separate addresses with a semi-colon. 
	
	![Set email address for alerts](media/personal/ALM_AN_Email.png)  

3.	Select the check box for each alert of interest. **My work items** and **My build** refer to work items and builds that you created.
	
	![Manage TFS alerts](media/personal/ALM_AN_ManageAlerts.png)

	Alert templates reference a customizable query. 
	
	The following alert types appear when your project is provisioned with Git for version control:  
	- **A commit is pushed to this project**  
	- **A pull request I've participated in is created or updated**  
	- **A build quality changes** 

	> [!TIP]    
	> When you clear an alert, you also clear all email addresses defined for the alert.  

4.	For more options, open custom alerts and choose one of the options available. Also, you can open a basic alert and modify its settings, such as changing the email format from HTML to plain text or SOAP. 
	
	![Open custom alerts](media/personal/ALM_AN_CustomAlerts.png)

5.	Define alert filters in the same way you define query filters.
	
	![Fill out the custom alerts form](media/personal/ALM_AN_DefiningAlerts.png)
	
	For a list of available fields, see [Index of work item fields](../boards/work-items/guidance/work-item-field.md).

6.	For even more options, open the Select New Alert Template. 
	
	![Open all alert options](media/personal/ALM_AN_Options.png)

7.	Choose from one of the several alert types listed.
	
	![Choose an alert type from all options listed](media/personal/ALM_AN_Templates.png)

## View all subscriptions

This view shows all subscriptions that you've created or that have been created by an administrator. Subscriptions let you control what you are notified about. Subscribed notifications are indicated with the State as **On**.

#### [Preview page](#tab/preview-page) 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Personal notification subscriptions](media/unsubscribe-personal-notifications-preview.png)

#### [Current page](#tab/current-page)

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017"   

A subscription can be just for you, or if you're a team admin, can be shared by everyone in the team.

## Add a custom subscription

With custom personal subscriptions, you can define precise criteria for the events you want to receive notifications. A custom subscription can notify you about any event. Default subscriptions differ, as they only notify users or groups directly associated with an event.

> [!NOTE]   
> To enable the new user interface for the Project Permissions Settings Page, see [Enable preview features](../project/navigation/preview-features.md).

#### [Preview page](#tab/preview-page) 

1. From your Notifications page, select **New subscription**.

	![Open the new subscriptions dialog](media/manage-personal-notifications-new-subscription-preview.png)

2. Choose the category and template you want to use. For a list of supported templates, see [Default and supported notifications](oob-built-in-notifications.md).

	Here we choose to get notified when a pull request is created within a specific project, Fabrikam Fiber.

	<img src="media/manage-personal-notifications-new-subscription-dialog-preview.png" alt="New subscription dialog" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />

3. Modify the description to help you identify the subscription later. Also choose an email address for notifications to be delivered to. By default, your preferred email address is used. optionally, include one or more fields to further specify the event criteria.

	<img src="media/manage-personal-notifications-complete-pull-request-subscription-preview.png" alt="Updated subscription dialog with field criteria" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />

	> [!NOTE]   
	> The fields available for filtering event criteria differ depending on the category and template you select.   

4. Select **Finish** when you're done. The subscription now appears in the list under the category you selected.

## Unsubscribe or opt out of a team or OOB subscription

You can choose to not receive notifications for certain team subscriptions by opting out of the subscription.

To unsubscribe from any notification, even one that you've defined, slide the State **On/Off** indicator to the Off position.
 
For example, here we turn off the Build completes subscription.

<img src="media/unsubscribe-from-build-completes-preview.png" alt="Unsubscribe from Build completes subscription" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />

> [!NOTE]  
> Whether you are an administrator or not, toggling a shared team subscription from your notification settings only impacts you and not other team members.
