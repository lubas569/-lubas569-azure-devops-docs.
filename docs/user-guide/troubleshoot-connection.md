# Troubleshoot connecting to a team project in VSTS or TFS 

[!INCLUDEÂ [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]


## Troubleshoot VSTS connectivity

As a first step in resolving connectivity issues with VSTS, do the following: 

0. Signout of your browser. You can do this by clicking this [Visual Studio Signout link](http://aka.ms/VsSignout).  

0. Delete your browser cookies. For most browsers, you can do this by entering CTRL+SHIFT+DEL.

0. Open Internet Explorer and delete cookies. Visual Studio IDE uses IE's cookies.

0. Close all browsers and the Visual Studio IDE. 

0. Use a private browser session to retry the connection to VSTS. If the issue is with VS IDE, remove the connection to VSTS after doing above and then re-add it.


## Troubleshoot TFS connectivity

Here's a list of the most frequently encountered connection problems and what to do about them. Start at the top and follow it in the order indicated.

1.  Verify that you have required permissions.

    If the errors that you receive indicate read-only or blocked actions, you might not have permission to act on the data.

2.  Verify that your computer is connected to the network and can access network resources.

3.  Verify that TFS hasn't been taken offline. Talk with your TFS administrator.

4.  Verify whether your team project has been moved to another team project collection in TFS. If it has been moved, you must create a connection to the new server name.

For additional troubleshooting tips, see [TF31002: Unable to connect to this Team Foundation Server](../work/customize/reference/error/tf31002-unable-connect-tfs.md).

## Switch between different organizational accounts in VSTS

When you use two or more VSTS accounts that are linked to directory tenants, such as accounts that are created from the Microsoft Azure Portal, the sign-out function may not work as expected. For example, you can't switch between different organizational accounts to connect to multiple accounts that are linked to directory tenants.

When this problem occurs, a blank sign flashes several times in the dialog box several times. Then, you'll receive one of the following error messages after you connect to or add a new connection in "Connect to Team Foundation Server" dialog box:

> TF31003: Either you have not entered the necessary credentials or your user account does not have permission to connect to the Team Foundation Server

> TF31002: Unable to connect to this Team foundation Server

To resolve this problem, apply Visual Studio 2013.2 or install a later version. Go to the [Visual Studio download website](http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads).

For a workaround in which you delete your browser cookies, see the following support article, [You can't switch between different organizational accounts in Visual Studio Online](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2958966/you-can-t-switch-between-different-organizational-accounts-in-visual-s).

## Connect to a TFS with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) configured

If you connect to a TFS instance that has SSL configured, then you'll need to install a certificate and clear the client cache. For details, see [Set up HTTPS with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for TFS, Configuring Client Computers](../tfs-server/admin/setup-secure-sockets-layer.md#config-client-computers). 


## Clear the cache on client computers  

When the on-premises TFS configuration changes, such as when moving or splitting a project collection, you might have to clear the cache.

1.  Log on to your client computer for Team Foundation by using the credentials of the user whose cache you want to clear.

2.  Close any open instances of Visual Studio.

3.  Open a browser, and browse to one of the following folders, depending on the operating system that is running on the client computer:  

    -   **Windows 10**  
        *Drive*:\\Users\<i>UserName</i>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Team Foundation\6.0\Cache  

    -   **Windows 8**  
        *Drive*:\\Users\<i>UserName</i>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Team Foundation\4.0\Cache  

    -   **Windows Vista or Windows 7**  
        *Drive*:\\Users\<i>UserName</i>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Team Foundation\2.0\Cache  

4.  Delete the contents of the Cache directory, including all subfolders.
