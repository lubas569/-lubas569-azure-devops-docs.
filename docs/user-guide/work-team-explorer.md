# Navigate in Team Explorer

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

You use Team Explorer to manage work that is assigned to you, your team, or your projects, and to coordinate your efforts with other team members to develop a project. Team Explorer is a plug-in that installs with Visual Studio or Eclipse. Working from different platforms, developers and stakeholders can effectively collaborate using Team Explorer connected to projects hosted on Azure DevOps Services or on-premises Team Foundation Server (TFS).


>[!TIP]  
>You can access the latest version of Visual Studio clients from the [Visual Studio Downloads page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). Additional options for connecting to Azure DevOps Services or TFS include:

> - [Team Explorer Everywhere](/../java/download-eclipse-plug-in.md)
> - [Azure DevOps Plugin for Android Studio](/../java/download-android-studio-plug-in.md)  
> - [Azure DevOps Plugin for IntelliJ](/../java/download-intellij-plug-in.md)
> - [Visual Studio Code](/../java/vscode-extension.md)
>For information about compatibility among client and server versions, see [Requirements and compatibility](/tfs/server/requirements).

The operations available to you depend on which source control option-Team Foundation version control (TFVC) or Git-was selected to manage source code when the project was created.

**Team Explorer plug-in for Visual Studio**

Team Explorer connects Visual Studio to projects. You can manage source code, work items, and builds. Or, create a project.

> [!TIP]  
> If you open Visual Studio and the Team Explorer pane doesn't appear, choose the **View/Team Explorer** menu option.

>[!NOTE]  
>Some pages, such as **Reports** and **Documents**, only appear when an on-premises TFS is configured with the required resources, such as SQL Server Reporting Services and SharePoint.

If you don't need Visual Studio, but do want to connect to Azure DevOps Services or TFS or get one or more Team Foundation add-ins, you can install the free [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs).

**Team Explorer plug-in for Eclipse**

If you work in Eclipse or on a non-Windows platform, you can [install the Team Explorer plug-in for Eclipse](/../java/download-eclipse-plug-in#_install-the-tee-plugin-for-eclipse). Once installed, you can share your Eclipse projects by adding them to Azure DevOps Services or TFS using [Git](../repos/git/share-your-code-in-git-eclipse.md) or [TFVC](../repos/tfvc/share-your-code-in-tfvc-eclipse.md).

## Choose the page to access the task you want

Based on the page you select and the options configured for your project.

### Connect page

From the **Connect** page, you can select the projects you want to connect to and quickly switch context between projects.

> [!div class="mx-tdBreakAll"]  
> |Git: Local Git repo |TFVC: Map workspace |

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> From the Visual Studio plug-in, you can [Create a project](../organizations/projects/create-project.md). The ability to create projects is not supported from the Eclipse plug-in. You can, however, create projects from the web portal/collection administration context. 



### Home, Work, and Build pages

### Git and TFVC pages  

The Git and TFVC repos support different pages and functions. You'll see one or the other pages depending on the project and repro you connect to. For a comparison of the two repos, see [Choosing the right version control for your project](../repos/tfvc/comparison-git-tfvc.md).

### Report and Document pages 

The **Report** page opens the [Reporting Services report site](../report/sql-reports/reporting-services-reports.md). This page appears only when your project has been configured with SQL Server Analysis Services and Reporting Services. Also, the option to **Create Report in Microsoft Excel** appears only when reporting has been configured for the project.

From the **Document** page, you can [open project portal](../report/sharepoint-dashboards/share-information-using-the-project-portal.md) and [manage documents and document libraries](../report/sharepoint-dashboards/manage-documents-and-document-libraries.md). This page appears only if your project has been configured with a SharePoint Products portal.
  
If your project is missing one or more pages, you may be able to [add functionality to your on premises TFS deployment](/tfs/server/admin/config-tfs-resources).

::: moniker-end

### Settings page 

From the **Settings** page, you can configure administrative features for either a project or project collection. Configuring features in these areas requires you to be a member of a an administrator group or have the required permissions.

Most of the links open to a web portal administration page. Not all settings are available from the Team Explorer plug-in for Eclipse. 

To learn more about settings, see [About team, project, and organizational-level settings](../organizations/settings/about-settings.md).

## Refresh Team Explorer 

If data doesn't appear as expected, the first thing to try is to refresh your client. Refreshing your client updates the local cache with changes that were made in another client or in TFS. To refresh Team Explorer, do one of the following actions:

-   To refresh a page that you are currently viewing, choose ![Refresh icon](../boards/_img/icons/te-refresh-query-icon.png) **Refresh** icon in the menu bar (or choose the F5 key).

-   To refresh the project you currently have selected, choose ![](_img/work-team-explorer/IC547418.png) **Home**, and then choose ![Refresh icon](../boards/_img/icons/te-refresh-query-icon.png) **Refresh** icon (or choose the F5 key).

-   To refresh the set of teams defined for the project that you currently have selected, choose the Connect icon, and then choose ![Refresh icon](../boards/_img/icons/te-refresh-query-icon.png) **Refresh** icon (or choose the F5 key).
