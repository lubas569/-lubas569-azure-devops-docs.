# Continuous integration and deployment  

<b>VSTS | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015  | TFS 2013</b> 

**NEW - To Be Completed**
 

Rapid and reliable release of software comes from automating as many processes as possible. Our systems support build, test, and release automation. 

- You can define builds to automatically run whenever a team member checks in code changes 
- Your build definitions can include instructions to run tests after the build runs 
- Release definitions support managing deployment of your software builds to staging or production environments
